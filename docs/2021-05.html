									Texas children hit with cease-and-desist order from local government after selling eggs to neighbors
<br />
<br />The two girls, 10-year-old Indiana and 8-year-old Phoenix, started collecting extra eggs from the chickens on their property and sold them to those in the community following the devastating Lone Star State freeze in February that roiled the region&#39;s food supply.
<br />
<br />The sisters generated about $70 per week under the guidance of their father, Brian Johnson, an Army veteran, before the city of Bulverde intervened.
<br />
<br />Johnson received a letter in the mail that demanded that he and his girls stop selling the eggs, he told CBS Austin on Thursday.
<br />
<br />Someone in the neighborhood complained about him keeping chickens &#34;for the purpose of producing and selling&#34; eggs, City Manager Danny Batts told the Washington Examiner.
<br />The &#34;keeping of 30 chickens in a residential neighborhood, while not common, is permissible&#34; under the city&#39;s ordinance, but &#34;the selling of chicken eggs, or any other animal products produced on the property, from a residentially zoned lot is a violation ... regardless of the age of the person conducting the sales,&#34; he added.

									“Run low on poultry” 
<br />
<br />The popularity of chicken -- from sandwiches and tenders to nuggets and wings -- is fueling such demand for fried poultry that America is starting to run short.
<br />
<br />KFC says it’s struggling to keep up with soaring demand for its new sandwich, while North Carolina-based chicken-and biscuits-chain Bojangles reported outages of tenders across its 750 locations.

									Biden Prepares For Stealth Food Stamp Increase Of Up To 20% Without Congressional Approval
<br />
<br />The Biden administration is planning to use an obscure US Department of Agriculture instrument to lay the groundwork for a long-term increase in food aid for tens of millions of Americans.
<br />
<br />The instrument, known as the &#39;market basket,&#39; is a shopping list used to determine food stamp benefits, and which can be adjusted without risking an impasse in Congress from Republican lawmakers, according to Bloomberg.
<br />
<br />&#34;This is really meaningful,&#34; according to Harvard professor Jason Furman, who was chairman of former President Obama&#39;s Council of Economic Advisers. &#34;It’s one of the bigger things government can do for poverty without Congress.&#34;

									Australian government officially recommends eating insects as part of our &#34;mainstream diet&#34; - 
<br />
<br />CSIRO:  To develop resilient food systems, we need to diversify global food supply chains. With more than 2,100 insect species currently eaten by two billion people from 130 countries, edible insects present an important opportunity. Insects have high-value nutritional profiles and commercial insect farming is considered to have a low environmental footprint. The global edible insect industry is growing fast with Europe and the United States of America the leading edible insect markets in the West. This report identifies the challenges and opportunities for the Australian edible insect industry providing a useful framework for First Nations initiatives, start-ups, insect businesses, researchers, policy makers, and members of the general public who are considering engaging with the emerging industry.

									Bugs for piglets. Cargill and InnovaFeed extend insect feed deal
<br />
<br />U.S. agriculture giant Cargill and French biotech firm InnovaFeed said they aim to feed 20 million piglets with insect oil by 2026 as part of a wider alternative protein deal.
<br />
<br />Insect feed has become an increasingly popular alternative in agriculture and aquaculture as demand for animal feed surges, pushing feed grain prices higher, and as more companies work toward reducing their carbon footprint.
<br />
<br />Cargill (CARGIL.UL) and InnovaFeed announced a first agreement in 2019, initially focusing on fish feed.
<br />
<br />&#34;The expansion of this partnership will include more species, starting with the use of oil derived from insects for pig feed,&#34; the companies said in a joint statement on Monday.

									Bird flu has led to a shortage of Swedish eggs
<br />
<br />An unusually contagious and airborne variant of bird flu has caused the deaths of approximately 1.5 million laying hens. Now there may be a shortage of Swedish eggs in grocery stores.
<br />
<br />1.5 million hens, which lay about one egg a day, and 700,000 young hens have been killed as a result of the bird flu. This has led to fewer Swedish eggs being produced and several grocery stores have switched to imported eggs.

									BRACE FOR IMPACT!
<br />
<br />The supply chain continues to deteriorate.  Need something, buy it now.  Need it ongoing?  Figure out how to grow/make it yourself:
<br />
<br />As Deutsche Bank analyst Amit Mehrotra told American Shipper back in March, “You ain’t seen nothing yet.” He was right. The latest data reveals that despite a deluge of inbound cargo since the second half of last year, import demand is not abating — it’s increasing.
<br />
<br />Importers are still playing catch-up. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Customers Inventories Index, released Monday, dropped to 28.4 for April. That set a new record for the lowest number since the index was created in 1997 and is down 34% from April 2019, pre-COVID.
<br />
<br />As one retail survey respondent told the ISM, “Market capacity in most areas is oversold, with no realistic improvement on the horizon. In fact, it appears that demand will continue to strengthen, leading to more significant disruptions.”

									Shedding? Or self spreading vaccine?
<br />
<br />Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists [Nov 2020]: What if instead of orchestrating complicated and resource-intensive campaigns to vaccinate humans against emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, we could instead stop the zoonotic diseases that sometimes leap from animals to people at their source? A small, but growing number of scientists think it’s possible to exploit the self-propagating properties of viruses and use them to spread immunity instead of disease. Can we beat viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus, at their own game?
<br />
<br />For obvious reasons, public and scientific interest in vaccines is incredibly high, including in self-spreading vaccines, as they could be effective against zoonotic threats. The biologists Scott Nuismer and James Bull generated fresh media attention to self-spreading vaccines over the summer after publishing an article in the journal Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution. But the subsequent reporting on the topic gives short shrift to the potentially significant downsides to releasing self-spreading vaccines into the environment.

									EU Endorses Beetle Larvae for Human Consumption, Touts ‘Environmental Benefits’
<br />
<br />Representatives from the European Union’s 27 member states have approved Tenebrio molitor beetle larvae, also known as mealworms, as “innovative” food and suitable for human consumption.
<br />
<br />[ IAF:  Yeah.  &#34;Innovative.&#34;  You&#39;ve heard this term for other &#34;innovative foods&#34; — along with &#34;replacement agriculture.&#34; ]
<br />
<br />The EU’s executive arm explained that dried mealworms could be eaten “whole” in the “form of snacks” or as an ingredient in food. Agence France-Presse also suggested on Tuesday that they could be used in protein shakes or to make burgers.
<br />
<br />The Commission went on to tout how eating bugs had “environmental benefits” and contributed to “sustainable diets”.

									#1 FAQ:  Where is a good place to be during #GrandSolarMinimum?
<br />
<br />My answer:  First, check out these maps of how the climate changed during previous grand minima:
<br />
<br />     <a href="http://wiki.iceagefarmer.com/wiki/Strategic_Relocation:_Maps" rel="noopener">http://wiki.iceagefarmer.com/wiki/Strategic_Relocation:_Maps</a>
<br />
<br />Use these as starting point to inform a more holistic process:  there are a number of considerations beyond basic geography/climate that need to be considered.  My recommendation is to run through an exercise like this as a tool to organize your thoughts:
<br />
<br />- Make a list of what is important to you: proximity to community/family.  growing more crops vs. pasture for animals.  etc.
<br />
<br />- Craft a risk analysis for each area considered: volcanic/seismic, water extremes (drought/flood), frosts ruining growing season, large population nearby, resource availability.
<br />
<br />- Rank the risks:  How likely are the risks?  How tolerant of each are you?  ( i.e., if you are chiefly raising animals, maybe a late frost doesn&#39;t matter.  if you are skilled builder with earthbags, an earthquake may not be end of world.).
<br />
<br />Now we have a risk matrix.  Instead of just picking of a place and then enumerating the reasons it would be a bad choice (we are all likely quite good at that by now, but it gets us nowhere), now you are starting to work to match your own risk preferences against the candidate areas, and understanding WHY an area is a good balance for you/your family.
<br />
<br />(because nothing is perfect)
<br />
<br />Open questions:  What has worked for you?  Why are you where you are?  How is it working?  How confident are you?

									Federal court upholds Impossible Foods&#39; GMO heme to make veggie burgers &#34;bleed&#34;, despite lack of any long-term health studies.
<br />
<br />Unsurprising, yes, given the public (and government) has already moved on to injecting themselves with OTHER unapproved GMOs:
<br />
<br />&#34;Impossible Foods derives its heme from the roots of soybean plants. It claims the compound is central to the meaty, umami flavor profile of its meat substitute products – as well as giving its Impossible Burger the characteristic ability to ‘bleed’ like rare-cooked beef.&#34;

									JBS (world&#39;s BIGGEST meat company) buys plant protein company Vivera for $409m - because, remember, it&#39;s Game Over for the meat industry: 
<br />
<br />Founded in the early 1990s and based in the small east Netherlands town of Holten, it offers a range of products including chicken-style nuggets and goujons, sausages, and ground ‘meat’. These are made from protein that has been derived from soybean, wheat, rice, and chickpea, among other sources.
<br />
<br />“This acquisition is an important step to strengthen our global plant-based protein platform. Vivera will give JBS a stronghold in the plant-based sector, with technological knowledge and capacity for innovation,” said JBS global CEO Gilberto Tomazoni.

									Scientists Create &#39;Flat-Pack&#39; Pasta That Morphs Into Shape When Cooked
<br />
<br />In our efforts to rein in our overwhelming burden upon Earth&#39;s living biosphere, every little thing adds up. Even the shape of pasta (of all things!) can make a difference in our consumption of resources.
<br />
<br />Which is why scientists have now created flat-packed pasta that&#39;s more efficient to package and transport, but can then unfurl into shape once it&#39;s in the pot.
<br />
<br />Food packaging is a huge contributor to landfills. In the US for instance, food packaging along with food waste makes up almost half of all solid consumer waste. But scientists estimate that flat-packed noodles could reduce pasta packaging by up to 60 percent, by eliminating all the air space included in different shaped pastas, like tubes of penne and spirals of fusilli, when packed.
<br />
<br />Inspired by space and resource-saving flat-packed furniture, digital fabrication researcher Ye Tao from Zhejiang University and colleagues created noodles that can change shape.
<br />
<br />Building on past experiments, where grooves stamped into flat pasta caused the noodles to spontaneously morph into 3D-shapes when submerged in water, the researchers used computer and physical tests to work out how to control these unnerving transformations.
<br />
<br />&#34;The groove side expands less than the smooth side, leading the pasta to morph into shape,&#34; explained Syracuse University biomechanical engineer Teng Zhang.
<br />
<br />And the morphing pasta puts on quite a show - twisting and writhing along strategically placed grooves like an unfurling flower or wiggling worm, as it swells with water.

									Family-owned restaurants around the U.S. are struggling to keep a steady supply of chicken tenders, wings and breasts on their customers&#39; plates due to a nationwide poultry shortage.
<br />Consumer demand for the bird has surged amid the coronavirus, with Americans turning to comfort foods and buying more chicken sandwiches from fast-food restaurants like KFC, McDonald&#39;s and Popeyes. As millions of Americans sat idle during stay-at-home orders last year and ordered chicken meals from local restaurants, poultry producers have been unable to keep pace.

									It&#39;s almost like building a fragile, globalized economy was a bad idea . . . 
<br />
<br />The Chip Shortage Keeps Getting Worse. Why Can’t We Just Make More?
<br />
<br />Shortages of semiconductors are battering automakers and tech giants, raising alarm bells from Washington to Brussels to Beijing. The crunch has raised a fundamental question for policymakers, customers and investors: Why can’t we just make more chips?
<br />
<br />There is both a simple answer and a complicated one. The simple version is that making chips is incredibly difficult—and getting tougher.
<br />
<br />“It’s not rocket science—it’s much more difficult,” goes one of the industry’s inside jokes.
<br />
<br />The more complicated answer is that it takes years to build semiconductor fabrication facilities and billions of dollars—and even then the economics are so brutal that you can lose out if your manufacturing expertise is a fraction behind the competition. Former Intel Corp. boss Craig Barrett called his company’s microprocessors the most complicated devices ever made by man.
<br />
<br />This is why countries face such difficulty in achieving semiconductor self sufficiency. China has called chip independence a top national priority in its latest five-year plan, while U.S. President Joe Biden has vowed to build a secure American supply chain by reviving domestic manufacturing. Even the European Union is mulling measures to make its own chips. But success is anything but assured.
<br />
<br />Manufacturing a chip typically takes more than three months and involves giant factories, dust-free rooms, multi-million-dollar machines, molten tin and lasers. The end goal is to transform wafers of silicon—an element extracted from plain sand—into a network of billions of tiny switches called transistors that form the basis of the circuitry that will eventually give a phone, computer, car, washing machine or satellite crucial capabilities.

									Lactobacillus (LAB) (EM1) is not only amazing for plants (mix a tiny bit in to compost tea or while watering), but also for your gut health (REAL probiotics! not store bought expensive stuff), for clearing drains or cleaning, and hundreds of other uses.
<br />
<br />&#34;Recipe&#34;:
<br />
<br />- Rice wash (dump rice in water, let it rest for a day, now you have water full of carbs)
<br />- Mix with milk, let it do its magic and separate into curds (can be used for cheese) and LAB.
<br />- Strain out the curds.  You now have magic LAB.

									It&#39;s because of SOYBEANS and farming that our nation&#39;s infrastructure is crumbling?
<br />
<br />STUDY:  STUDY SHOWS LEADING SOYBEAN-PRODUCING STATES HAVE DAMAGED BRIDGES
<br />
<br />The head of the Soy Transportation Coalition says data from a new report suggests structurally deficient bridges in leading soybean-producing states could threaten farmer profitability.
<br />
<br />Mike Steenhoek, executive director, says the report shows what states have the highest number of damaged bridges and a shutdown would disrupt how producers transport products to market. “When you’re transporting 900 bushels of soybeans in a truck, detours can be quite expensive particularly if you have to do many trips from the farm to the elevator or processing facility,” he says. “That detour is real money.”

									Cyberattack on critical pipeline freezes deliveries to U.S. East Coast
<br />
<br />[fuel prices set to explode]
<br />
<br />The main fuel supply line to the U.S. East Coast was shut down on Friday after the pipeline&#39;s operator was hit by what is believed to be the largest successful cyberattack on oil infrastructure in the country&#39;s history.
<br />
<br />The attack on the Colonial Pipeline, which runs 5,500 miles and provides nearly half the fuel used on the East Coast, affected some of the company’s IT systems. Colonial said in a statement late Friday that it has engaged an unidentified third-party cybersecurity firm to investigate the incident, and has contacted law enforcement and other federal agencies.
<br />
<br />The attack presents a major test for how the Biden administration will respond to cyber attacks on critical infrastructure at a time when hackers are increasingly targeting essential utility services. The outage, depending on its duration and who is found to be behind it, could send fuel prices in the southeastern U.S. above $3 a gallon, market analysts said.
<br />
<br />&#34;I’m unaware anything approaching this magnitude in the U.S.,&#34; said Bob McNally, president of energy consultancy Rapidan Energy, who served on the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration. &#34;In the U.S., this is a new escalation, a much more important attack on a vital piece of infrastructure.&#34;

<br />Lysine therapy interrupts the replication of viruses, including COVID-19 coronavirus, by countering arginine, an amino acid that fosters the eruption of dormant viruses.  Lysine has been safely used for decades to quell herpes virus outbreaks that cause cold sores on the lips (herpes labialis), a treatment pioneered by one of the Bio-Virus Research team members in 1974.
<br />
<br />Foods that have a high ratio of lysine over arginine such as eggs, tofu, fish (not raw), sardines, cheese, meats such as pork, poultry and red meat, and yogurt) provide a high ratio of lysine over arginine, thus blocking replication of all coronaviruses including COVID-19.
<br />
<br />Lysine is available in foods and in concentrated form in inexpensive dietary supplements (250 500-milligram lysine tablets can be purchased for under $5 US or 2-cents per tablet), making affordable lysine therapy possible.

Backed by decades of research and safety data for herpes-family viruses, U.S.-based researchers at Bio-Virus Research Inc, Reno, Nevada, report on the successful treatment of the first 30 frontline doctors and nurses and a thousand-plus patients given the amino acid lysine to prevent and … Continue reading →</p>

									WOW.  Is this story real, or is media already laying that framework, making the case for digitial/blockchain vaccine passports? 
<br />
<br />A California bar owner has been arrested for allegedly selling fake COVID-19 vaccination cards in what&#39;s believed to be the first thwarted scheme of its kind.
<br />
<br />Undercover agents [!!] with the state&#39;s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control bought the bogus cards for $20 each during multiple visits to the Old Corner Saloon in Clements, a small town in San Joaquin County.
<br />
<br />&#34;On the back where they put the two dates when you were vaccinated, they used two different color pens to make it look like it was two different times,&#34; supervising agent Luke Blehm told the AP. &#34;So they went to some effort to make it look authentic.&#34;  [IAF:  That counts as effort?  I&#39;m in the wrong business]
<br />
<br /> &#34;We just can&#39;t do it the OLD way, on paper, in this new normal...&#34;

									China buys most corn since January despite pledge to change feed mix
<br />
<br />CHICAGO, May 7 (Reuters) - Chinese buyers bought 1.36 million tonnes of U.S. corn, matching their seventh biggest ever purchase of U.S. supplies of the grain, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Friday.
<br />
<br />The deal comes after China issued guidelines in April recommending the reduction of corn and soymeal in pig and poultry feed. Corn prices Cv1 have surged to their highest in more than eight years on concerns about a tightening global supply base due to strong demand in biofuels and dry conditions in key growing areas of Brazil.
<br />
<br />The corn will be shipped during the 2021/22 marketing year that starts in September, USDA said.
<br />
<br />The deal was China&#39;s biggest since it booked a deal to buy 2.1 million tonnes of U.S. corn, its most ever from the United States, in January.

									Labor Shortage Sets Off &#34;Inflationary Time Bomb&#34; McDonalds Franchises Warn, Fearing Big Mac Price Hike

<br />
<br />The National Owners Association (NOA), an independent, self-funded advocacy group of McDonald&#39;s franchisees, sent a letter to its members Sunday criticizing &#34;hiring challenges on the &#34;perverse effects of the current unemployment benefits.&#34;

<br />Of those, an estimated 12,700 deaths -- around 80% -- are connected to production of animal-based foods.

<br />The bridge into Memphis was shut down Tuesday afternoon after the crack was discovered during a routine inspection. Both states&#39; transportation agencies said they would make sure the 48-year-old, 1.8-mile (2.9-kilometer) bridge is safe before reopening.

									Panic-buying has emptied 28 percent of North Carolina’s fuel stations and is exacerbating gasoline shortages across the Southeast, underscoring the real-world implications of a cyberattack that forced Colonial Pipeline offline last week.
<br />
<br />More than 17 percent of the stations in Georgia and Virginia were dry Wednesday, according to GasBuddy, and states as far as West Virginia and Kentucky also are running out. Major metropolitan areas have been hit hardest by the shortages, with more than 70 percent of the stations out of gasoline in Charlotte, Raleigh and Greenville, as well as roughly 60 percent of those in Norfolk and Atlanta, according to Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy’s head oil analyst.

									Coast Guard has stopped all river traffic - over 400 barges are already backed up:
<br />
<br />So much grain flows through here..!
<br />
<br />“More than 400 barges were delayed on the lower Mississippi River on Wednesday after a bridge crack prompted the U.S. Coast Guard to halt vessel traffic on a portion of the waterway crucial for shipping crops to export markets.
<br />
<br />The disruption hit as strong demand for U.S. corn and soybeans has tightened inventories and pushed crop prices to their highest in more than eight years. Also, U.S. President Joe Biden is seeking to have Congress approve a $2.25 trillion infrastructure bill.
<br />
<br />The Coast Guard stopped all traffic on the Mississippi River near Memphis - between mile markers 736 and 737 - after a crack was discovered in the Hernando de Soto Bridge that spans the river, according to a statement.
<br />
<br />There were 12 vessels with 157 barges in the queue to pass northbound and 16 vessels with 254 barges in the queue to go southbound, Lieutenant Mark Pipkin, a Coast Guard spokesman, told Reuters. The barges are carrying a mix of materials including crude oil and dry cargo like corn or rocks, he said.
<br />
<br />Pipkin said it is not known when the river will reopen.

									Omaha metro restaurant owners face tough decisions amid food supply shortage
<br />
<br />OMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Big changes could be on the way for your favorite restaurants as owners say they are facing supply shortages.
<br />
<br />Ping Wang owns Ming’s Restaurant in Papillion. He says he is dealing with a huge shortage of products. Everything from produce to proteins, to the oil food is cooked in.
<br />
<br />“Things we would order six or seven cases of, our suppliers are telling us we can only have two cases so it’s fair for everybody else,” said Ping Wang, Ming’s Restaurant owner.
<br />
<br />&gt; Dear Customers, Many of you may be aware and maybe not. We are experiencing a major supply chain breakdown due to the...
<br />
<br />“Meat prices have tripled. Oil prices, like we use three-gallon jugs of soy oil and it used to be $11.98 for a three-gallon jug. It’s $33.75 now,” said Wang.
<br />
<br />Wang says his business is absorbing those extra costs as long as they can because they don’t want to raise prices their customers pay.
<br />
<br />Other restaurants say they’ve already been forced to do just that.

									US Forces Now Stealing Syrian Wheat:
<br />
<br />A convoy, comprising 10 American trucks, has reportedly smuggled grain stolen from silos in Syria’s northeastern Hasakah Province to Iraq’s western Anbar Governorate.
<br />
<br />Citing local sources, Syria’s official SANA news agency reported that the US trucks loaded with grain from Tal Allo silos, located in al-Ya’rubyia area in Qamishli countryside, entered Iraq via the al-Waleed Border Crossing.
<br />
<br />On Thursday, US occupation forces also took 32 trucks of stolen wheat out of Syria, the report said.
<br />
<br />The Americans, SANA said, are engaged in looting Syrian energy resources and grain with the help of the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mainly Kurdish militants operating against Damascus.
<br />
<br />The US troops control most of oil wells in Hasakah, where they have deployed thousands of truckloads of weapons as well as military and logistical equipment in recent months.
<br />
<br />Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. The Syrian government says the Western countries and their regional allies are aiding Takfiri terrorist groups that are wreaking havoc in the Arab country.
<br />
<br />Syria, which has not authorized the presence of the US military in its territory, says Washington is “plundering” the country’s oil.
<br />
<br />The presence of US terrorist forces in northeastern Syria has particularly irked local residents who have on several occasions stopped American military convoys.

<br />Boom in backyard chicken coops brings salmonella risk
<br />
<br />As if we don’t already have enough to beware of to keep us from getting sick, now health experts say we need to be cautious of our pets.
<br />
<br />Yes, they have many benefits – studies show they can reduce our blood pressure, cholesterol levels and help us manage feelings of loneliness and depression.
<br />
<br />But they can also carry harmful germs.
<br />
<br />When dogs lick us, cats prowl on countertops or a child snuggles with a backyard chicken, it can be a health problem.
<br />
<br />According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, backyard chicken coops exploded last year, as did salmonella outbreaks from handling the birds.
<br />
<br />Bacteria can spread from live poultry via their feces. They walk in it, peck in it and roll around in dirt, and it can get on their feathers and beaks. That’s why the CDC advises against cuddling or kissing your pet poultry,” said Sana Mujahid with Consumer Reports.
<br />
<br />Even animals that are healthy and well taken care of can carry germs like E. coli or salmonella.

									“It remains to be seen when barge traffic will be allowed to resume, but any suspension of traffic -- even temporarily -- on the Mississippi River is most unwelcome to U.S. agriculture.
<br />
<br />According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in the week ending May 1, 438 barges moved down river destined for Gulf export facilities. Most of these barges were loaded in areas north of Memphis. It is reasonable to assume hundreds of barges of U.S. grain will be negatively impacted by the closure depending on its duration.&#34;
<br />
<br />Steenhoek said it is important to regard this bridge closure and the resulting suspension of traffic in the broader context of a national and global supply chain that is currently under tremendous stress.

									World Economic Forum pushing the insects/worms:
<br />
<br />Worms for dinner? Europe backs insect-based food in a bid to promote alternative protein
<br />
<br />* The European Union just gave the green light to using mealworms in food.
<br />* Edible insects are high in proteins and vitamins.
<br />* They also consume fewer natural resources than livestock.
<br />* Worms are now firmly on the menu in Europe.
<br />
<br />The European Union (EU) has ruled that the larval stage of the Tenebrio molitor beetle, the mealworm, is safe for people to eat and it will shortly be on the market as a “novel food”.
<br />
<br />EU researchers said that the worms, eaten whole or in powder form, are protein-rich, while the UN Food and Agriculture Organization said that edible insects “contain high-quality protein, vitamins and amino acids for humans”.

									More good news! Montana passes SB 199 : support local food systems!
<br />
<br />On April 30, Governor Greg Gianforte signed Senate Bill 199 (SB 199), also known as the Montana Local Food Choice Act, into law. Senator Greg Hertz (R-Polson) sponsored the bill. The new law goes into effect immediately.
<br />
<br />SB 199 allows the unregulated intrastate sale of most homemade foods from producers to informed end consumers including all raw dairy products if the producer keeps no more than “five lactating cows, 10 lactating goats or 10 lactating sheep” on the farm for the production of milk. There are limited testing requirements for raw milk producers. Producers can sell poultry under the Act if they slaughter and process no more than 1,000 birds during a calendar year and comply with federal recordkeeping requirements.
<br />Livestock producers and homemade food producers may sell “meat and meat products processed at a state-licensed establishment or a federally approved meat establishment” but only if they have obtained a temporary food establishment permit.
<br />
<br />Producers must inform the end consumer that the homemade food they are selling has not been licensed, permitted, certified, packaged, labeled nor inspected. Sales and delivery under SB 199 can take place at a farm, ranch, home office, “traditional community social event” (the term includes farmers markets) as defined by the bill, or another location agreed to between the producer and/or the producer’s agent and the informed end consumer.

									Meat prices soaring due to cost of grains for feed — this is why China/Brazil were rapidly reformulating and moving to wheat:
<br />
<br />It’s Not Just Fuel — $7 Corn Is Sending Meat Prices Soaring
<br />
<br />Two of the biggest global meat suppliers JBS and Tyson announced this week that consumer meat prices would rise due to soaring grain costs and unfavorable market conditions. With the Consumer Price Index showing meat prices up 2% already in April, which is expected to increase as the rise plays out across the meat industry. 
<br />
<br />“We have had a sharp increase in costs,” JBS S.A. CEO Gilberto Tomazoni said Thursday. “Grain costs are a structural condition that will stay here for a while. We will adapt our pricing and work on efficiencies to mitigate this cost increase.”

									“Any additional shock throws it into another downward spiral. That&#39;s what is happening now,” Bullard said. “The cattle producers’ prices are so severely depressed that any minor shock to the live cattle supply chain now has severe consequences.”
<br />
<br />Earlier this month, R-CALF, the lobbying organization for the nation’s 5,000 independent cattlemen, warned that rising grain prices would put some of the last independent producers left in the meat industry out of business. Between 2010 to 2014, thousands of independents were driven out of the beef industry. 
<br />
<br />R-CALF president Bill Bullard said $7 corn in a competitive livestock market would not create as bad of a problem. But he says he’s now heard of producers like one that’s been in business 46 years questioning if they will make it another season.

									Completely insane.  Do you remember the 17 million mink Denmark culled &#34;because COVID,&#34; (transporting them through the streets willy nilly with bodies falling off the trucks)?
<br />
<br />Then they weren&#39;t buried deep enough so they rose to the surface.
<br />
<br />Now they are digging up 4 million of them to &#34;prevent water contamination&#34; !
<br />
<br />&#34;More than 17 million mink were culled, despite the Danish government lacking authority to order the mass killing of the healthy animals. In addition to devastating the nation’s fur industry — the largest in the European Union — the culling has also sparked concern regarding pollution among other environmental issues.&#34;
<br />
<br />The agriculture minister later resigned after the government admitted it had acted illegally and while scientists believe the dangerous strain to now be extinct, the race to bury the creatures caused them to rise from the dead, so to speak.
<br />
<br />Efforts to excavate 4 million minks across two different Danish territories, located near a drinking and bathing water supply for a military training area, kicked off on Thursday and are expected to cost $24.4 million.

									The UK’s absurd ban on ‘junk food’ adverts will outlaw products that have lots of fat and sugars. Watch out, breast milk…
<br />
<br />“Among the many things mentioned in the Queen&#39;s Speech this week, setting out the legislative plans of Boris Johnson&#39;s British government, was that “measures will be brought forward to support the health and wellbeing of the nation, including to tackle obesity.”
<br />
<br />No one would argue that breast milk is unhealthy, yet it can contain two percent saturated fat and seven percent sugars. If it were a commercial product, would it fall foul of the rules, too? According to the government&#39;s nutrition profile rules, it’s sailing close to the wind, scoring three points when the trigger level is four.

									Soaring Prices, Rotting Crops: Coronavirus Triggers Global Food Crisis
<br />Processing and transportation breakdowns, panic buying threaten vulnerable nations; ‘a food crisis with lots of food’
<br />
<br />&gt; “In the past, we have always dealt with either a demand-side crisis, or a supply-side crisis. But this is both—a supply and a demand crisis at the same time, and at a global level,” said Arif Husain, chief economist at the UN’s World Food Program. “This makes it unprecedented and uncharted.”
<br />
<br />The coronavirus pandemic hit the world at a time of plentiful harvests and ample food reserves. Yet a cascade of protectionist restrictions [IAF: this is exactly the script of Soros/Podesta run &#39;Food Chain Reaction Game&#39; — pesky nationalists and protectionism caused a global food crisis...], transport disruptions and processing breakdowns has dislocated the global food supply and put the planet’s most vulnerable regions in particular peril.
<br />
<br />“You can have a food crisis with lots of food. That’s the situation we’re in,” said Abdolreza Abbassian, a senior economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, or FAO.
<br />
<br />Prices for staples such as rice and wheat have jumped in many cities, in part because of panic buying set off by export restrictions imposed by countries eager to ensure sufficient supplies at home. Trade disruptions and lockdowns are making it harder to move produce from farms to markets, processing plants and ports, leaving some food to rot in the fields.
<br />
<br />At the same time, more people around the world are running short of money as economies contract and incomes shrivel or disappear. Currency devaluations in developing nations that depend on tourism or depreciating commodities like oil have compounded those problems, making imported food even less affordable.

									Lab-grown fish is arriving:

<br />&#34;The production of cell-based seafood requires the extraction of muscle cells from fish, molluscs, or crustaceans, followed by their propagation in ideal conditions inside a bioreactor. Cells are typically grown on an edible scaffold that’s designed to give them the structure and texture of wild-caught meat. The ideal result is that cultured seafood becomes indistinguishable from wild-caught fish. &#34;

									Commentary: Chip Shortage Forcing Farmers to Plan Ahead
<br />
<br />The biggest factor impacting the ability of U.S. farmers to produce the food we need has nothing to do with the weather, the markets, trade, regulations, or disease. The worldwide shortage of computer chips will impact all aspects of agriculture for the next two years and beyond.  Almost every piece of farm equipment, like most everything else in our lives, needs a computer chips to operate. Due in part to the Covid 19 Pandemic, there is a massive worldwide shortage of chips; and the industry is unable to meet the skyrocketing demand. Industry sources say the current shortage will not be resolved until sometime in 2022.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, farm equipment manufacturers have halted shipments to dealers because they don’t have the chips to put in the equipment.  Reynolds Farm Equipment, one of Indiana’s largest John Deere dealers, says they are unsure about when thy will receive the new equipment that is on order. Bane Welker Equipment, which handles Case and  several other brands at their dealerships in IN and OH, are urging customers to plan ahead. They indicated that not only have combine, planter, tillage, and tractor sales been impacted, but even ATV supplies are limited. Parts, even non-electric parts, are also in short supply because the manufacturers of those parts use the chips in the manufacturing process. As farmers integrate technology into all aspects of the farming process, these highly sophisticated semi-conductors have become the backbone of almost every farming operation.

									The entire region is in extreme or exceptional drought, according to federal monitoring reports, and Oregon’s Klamath County is experiencing its driest year in 127 years.
<br />
<br />PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — The water crisis along the California-Oregon border went from dire to catastrophic this week as federal regulators shut off irrigation water to farmers from a critical reservoir and said they would not send extra water to dying salmon downstream or to a half-dozen wildlife refuges that harbor millions of migrating birds each year.
<br />
<br />In what is shaping up to be the worst water crisis in generations, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said it will not release water this season into the main canal that feeds the bulk of the massive Klamath Reclamation Project, marking a first for the 114-year-old irrigation system. The agency announced last month that hundreds of irrigators would get dramatically less water than usual, but a worsening drought picture means water will be completely shut off instead.
<br />
<br />“This year’s drought conditions are bringing unprecedented hardship to the communities of the Klamath Basin,” said Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, calling the decision one of “historic consequence.” “Reclamation is dedicated to working with our water users, tribes and partners to get through this difficult year and developing long-term solutions for the basin.”

									UK government to pay older farmers to retire
<br />
<br />Older farmers will be paid to retire under a UK government scheme to bring new blood into the trade.
<br />
<br />The average farmer could receive a lump sum payment of £50,000 - capped at £100,000 for farmers with most land.
<br />
<br />It is part of a massive overhaul of farm grants, incentivising farmers to protect the environment.
<br />
<br />Older farmers are often most resistant to new &#34;green&#34; methods, and Environment Secretary George Eustice wants them to move on.

<br />Argentine port workers extend strike, halting grains exports
<br />
<br />BUENOS AIRES — Argentina’s grains exports were paralyzed on Wednesday after port workers launched a strike over what they described as a lack of COVID-19 vaccinations among members, the head of the Port and Maritime Activities chamber told Reuters by telephone.
<br />
<br />In a statement, the port worker unions said the strike would run until late on Friday. Earlier the labor groups said they would end the work stoppage on Thursday, but they extended the strike due to what they called government inaction over their demands.
<br />
<br />Dock workers who prepare ships to sail were among those on strike, along with tugboat captains and sailors who guide cargo ships to and from port, according to the statement. In addition, dock-side grains inspectors represented by the powerful Urgara union said on Wednesday they were joining the work stoppage.
<br />
<br />“All shipping is stopped,” Guillermo Wade, general manager of the CAPyM chamber, said.
<br />
<br />Argentina is the world’s top exporter of soymeal livestock feed, used to fatten hogs and poultry form Europe to Southeast Asia. The South American grains powerhouse is also the world’s No. 3 corn supplier and a major wheat exporter.
<br />
<br />The strike hits during the high export season as Argentine growers are currently harvesting their main cash crops of soy and corn.

									Conditions in South America are so dry, barges are unable to float full loads on the river to export grains:
<br />
<br />Argentine soy and corn harvesting is being driven by ideal weather conditions, but the lack of rain that is helping farmers bring in crops is also contributing to the shallowness of the Parana River, which has begun to dent agricultural exports, according to a report by Reuters.
<br />
<br />Lack of navigability on the river, which carries about 80% of Argentine grain exports, is “an underestimated problem” for exporters, German Heinzenknecht, a meteorologist at consultancy Applied Climatology, said.

									Argentine farm groups will halt trading of livestock in protest against a 30-day government ban on beef exports aimed at bringing down domestic prices, the country&#39;s main producer groups said in a joint statement May 18.
<br />
<br />Reuters reported that the South American country&#39;s center-left Peronist government unveiled the &#39;emergency measure&#39; the day before to tamp down high inflation, putting it on a potential collision course with the powerful farm sector that drives exports.
<br />
<br />The country&#39;s four main rural associations said in a statement they would launch a nine-day halt in livestock trading starting May 20 in protest and could take further measures.
<br />
<br />The standoff underscores the fragile balance the government needs to strike between supporting farm exports that bring in much-needed foreign currency and bringing down damaging runaway inflation that is set to near 50% this year.
<br />
<br />The tension also reflects mounting global concerns about rising food prices that have seen other countries also move to control exports, including top wheat-producer Russia, which has imposed an tax on exports of the grain.

									UK DEFRA unveils details on plan to PAY farmers to stop farming, called &#34;lump sum exit payments&#34;.
<br />
<br />Let me just EMPHASIZE RIDICULOUSLY the terms of the payment:  &gt;&gt; Farmers will have to sell or rent out their land (or surrender their tenancy), though they will be able to keep their dwelling place and up to 5% of their agricultural land. &lt;&lt;. There IS NO GOING BACK.  (Just like the Dutch farmers selling &#34;Pig Rights&#34; reported in March.)
<br />
<br />__________
<br />Lump sum payments of up to £100,000 revealed by Defra
<br />
<br />Farmers claiming under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) in England will soon be able to receive their money in advance as part of a lump sum exit scheme, Defra has confirmed.
<br />
<br />The plans are contained in a long-awaited consultation, due to be released by Defra today (19 May), dealing with one aspect of the transition from the old CAP support regime to a new UK farm support policy, based on the use of “public money for public goods”.
<br />
<br />Defra has already set out a schedule for phasing out direct payments over the next seven years, starting with 5% cuts this scheme year, rising to 50% in 2024, with additional cuts for larger recipients.
<br />
<br />But it has now set out plans to allow those farmers wishing to quit the sector to take their future BPS money up front, so creating opportunities for new entrants and those wishing to expand their businesses.
<br />
<br />The scheme will open in 2022 and to be eligible, the consultation suggests participants need to have been claiming BPS since 2015 or earlier, so as to limit it to more established farmers. There may, however, be an exemption for people who have inherited a farm or succeeded to an Agricultural Holdings Act tenancy more recently.
<br />
<br />Farmers taking part will see their BPS entitlements cancelled, and will have to sell or rent out their land (or surrender their tenancy), though they will be able to keep their dwelling place and up to 5% of their agricultural land.
<br />
<br />In return, the proposal is that they will receive a payment worth 2.35 times a reference amount, expected to be the average annual BPS payment they received from 2018-20. As such, a £25,000 direct payment would qualify for a lump sum in 2022 of £58,750.

									Expect the poultry shortages to continue because poultry producers aren&#39;t willing to shell out the cash to build new capacity given the run up in commodities prices.  Case in point:
<br />
<br />__
<br />
<br />Sanderson Farms, the third-largest poultry producer in the US (whose engineering firm likely recommended them to suspend plans for plant expansion because prices on everything from lumber to steel to concrete to plastic to copper to machinery to labor skyrocketed, making building unaffordable) has decided that it will pass on expanding its operation despite surging demand for its product that has put it on the cusp of running out of chicken wings.
<br />
<br />&#34;I need a plant to open up next week, but it is not a good time to be building,&#34; said Chief Executive Joe Sanderson, who Bloomberg quoted. 
<br />
<br />As we have reported, demand for chicken in the US is through the roof. Without expansion, the nation&#39;s third largest poultry plant can&#39;t take any new orders: 
<br />
<br />&#34;We&#39;re totally sold out and we&#39;ve had people call us to service them and we cannot take on anymore business, and that&#39;s not a good place,&#34; Sanderson said.
<br />
<br />Sanderson said construction of the new chicken plant was expected to begin in the first half of the year. He said we&#39;ve been &#34;look very hard&#34; at surging building costs and is mulling over plans to shelve the expansion until raw material costs come down.

											<p>"We're totally sold out and we've had people call us to service them and we cannot take on anymore business, and that's not a good place," Sanderson said.

									A bit of relief last 48h - but still awfully dry.

<br />Plentiful Rainfall Again Misses Northern Plains, Upper Midwest
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the moisture did not make it farther north than Nebraska, resulting in continued degradations across the Northern Plains, Upper Midwest, and Great Lakes, according to today&#39;s Drought Monitor report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
<br />
<br />Elsewhere, portions of Virginia and North Carolina have continued to dry out over the past 90 days, warranting D0 expansion.

									A new [rather reductionist but still interesting] study from Michigan Tech and the University of Alaska at Fairbanks looks at possible ways to not only supplement but supply in large part a household’s protein needs, just with what can be raised (or grown) in a backyard.
<br />
<br />Using National Institutes of Health figures for protein requirements—56 grams per day for sedentary men and 46g per day for sedentary women, for an average of 51g per day—the researchers attempted to find out how much of a household’s annual protein needs could be met by turning their backyards into a productive mini-farm. The results varied considerably based on all kinds of factors; pasture-raising rabbits, especially, requires certain kinds of land.
<br />
<br />Depending on the specifics—and ignoring some problematic variables such as climate—backyard animals could technically provide enough protein for a family of two to four, but not necessarily easily. You’d have to raise 52 chickens (mostly for their eggs) and 107 rabbits in a single year to meet that mark, which may not be entirely practical. Soybeans, despite their lower protein content, were fully able to meet a family’s protein needs.
<br />
<br />American backyards, with their classic green lawn, aren’t doing anything for us. Maybe they should be.

									North American pallet shortage to last for a longer period
<br />
<br />The lack of pallets is adding stress to a supply chain that is already facing significant challenges which include a lack of available trucks and shipping containers, ongoing labor challenges, fluctuating fuel costs, pandemic-related challenges and a pending shortage of resin used to make reusable containers and pallets.
<br />
<br />The current price of lumber, shortage of trucks and marine containers could affect the price of fresh produce and flowers, Ed Treacy with Produce Marketing Association warns. Due, in part, to the lumber shortage, there’s a shortage of pallets – a vital part of the production chain. Ed rings the bell on this topic and advises both the fresh produce as the floral industry to prepare for a longer period of pallet shortage.
<br />
<br />“There is currently a shortage of all types of pallets available for rent or sale in the U.S. This is not unique to just the produce and floral industry”, Produce Marketing Association (PMA) Vice President Supply Chain and Sustainability Ed Treacy alerted its members earlier this month. “The shortage is across all types of pallets. “Not just rental company pallets, all pallets.”
<br />
<br />A multitude of issues are impacting pallet availability including:
<br />
<br />• Efforts of wholesalers, distributors and retailers to ensure sufficient inventory of non-perishables given previous pandemic-related impacts.
<br />
<br />• The availability of lumber to repair and build new pallets.
<br />
<br />• The escalating price of lumber when it is available.
<br />
<br />• Non-perishable inventory dwell time increase.
<br />
<br />• Lack of available trucks to relocate pallets.
<br />
<br />He expects this situation to last for a longer period and advises shippers and receivers to work together. The supply chain must balance organizational goals relative to overall availability of goods with availability of food. If there is not a concerted effort across the supply chain to ensure pallet availability for shipment of produce, there is little doubt that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for the grower/shipper community to meet buyer, and ultimately consumer, demand for produce. Simultaneously, growers and shippers are working hard to remain compliant with pallet requirement specifications where they can, but this is proving challenging.  Temporary modifications or exceptions to pallet requirements, as long as they do not jeopardize safety, would prove advantageous until this pallet shortage is resolved.

									Look how they slip in the new model: surveillance in this FDA release on AI in healthcare:
<br />
<br />New FDA AI Tool is Advancing Health Care
<br />
<br />The Food and Drug Administration has launched a new artificial intelligence tool for detecting cancer screening, the latest example of the agency’s further innovation around artificial intelligence and machine learning for health care applications.
<br />
<br />The new tool, called GI Genius, is the first to use AI based on machine learning to help clinicians detect lesions in the colon in real time during a colonoscopy. The system was able to identify lab-confirmed adenomas or carcinomas in over 55% of patients, compared to 42% via a standard colonoscopy, said Dr. Matthew Diamond, chief medical officer for digital health at FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
<br />
<br />“AI has the potential to transform health care to better assist health care providers and improve patient care,” Diamond told GovernmentCIO Media &amp; Research. “When AI is combined with traditional screenings OR SURVEILLANCE METHODS, it could help find problems early on, when they may be easier to treat.” 
<br />
<br />In its recent action plan for “software as a medical device,” FDA outlined a multi-pronged approach regarding oversight of AI and machine learning-based medical software, including advancing real-world performance pilots and creating other regulatory efforts around AI algorithms.

									Wow. Suddenly food production is on center stage. The Greta character comes out and says all the talking points about transforming food supply - rather remarkable - suddenly:
<br />
<br />1) farming/ranching is dirty and dangerous - she echoes Fauci in saying animal agriculture was responsible for pandemics starting in human history, and blaming meat for COVID-19
<br />
<br />2) calls for plant-based diet and post-animal economy
<br />
<br />3) linking the climate crisis to the &#34;public health&#34; crisis of COVID to your diet - just like Rockefeller&#39;s &#34;Reset the Table&#34;
<br />
<br />I also would note that when you see these talking points injected at this level - something big is up with food and this is getting people primed with the idea that it needs to change.

<br />
<br />Greta Thunberg aims to change how food is produced
<br />
<br />Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has set her sights on changing how the world produces and consumes food in order to counteract a trio of threats: carbon emissions, disease outbreaks and animal suffering.
<br />
<br />In a video posted on Twitter on Saturday, Thunberg said the environmental impact of farming as well as disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, which is believed to have originated from animals, would be reduced by changing how food was produced.
<br />
<br />... A focus on agriculture and linking the climate crisis to health pandemics is a new angle for Thunberg who has typically focused her ire on policy-makers and carbon emissions from fossil fuels.
<br />
<br />&#34;The climate crisis, ecological crisis and health crisis, they are all interlinked,&#34; she said.
<br />
<br />Thunberg said the spillover of diseases from animals to humans was caused by farming methods, adding that a move to a plant-based diet could save up to 8 billion tonnes of CO2 each year.

<br />Pope calls for radical food-production rethink
<br />
<br />(ANSA) - Vatican City, January 31 - Pope Francis called for a radical rethink in the way food is produced during an audience with Italian farmers&#39; association Coldiretti on Saturday. &#34;The basis of the system of producing and distributing food must be rethought,&#34; the pope said. The Argentine pontiff blasted &#34;absolutizing market rules, a culture of waste and waste that in the case of food has unacceptable proportions, together with other factors, cause misery and suffering for many families&#34;.
<br />
<br />    He also stressed that it was important to remember that humankind is called not only to cultivate the land, but also to preserve it. In a time of climate change the Pope noted, this is difficult, that is why, he said, it is so vital that nations are able to work together to protect creation.

									Silicon Chip Shortage Leads To Potato Chip Shortage: Farmers Halt Equipment Shipments To Dealers
<br />
<br />According to a new report, the worldwide chip shortage is impacting the agriculture industry that may last for a couple of years and has already impacted the price of potato chips.
<br />
<br />Hoosier Ag Today reports, “The biggest factor impacting the ability of US farmers to produce the food we need has nothing to do with the weather, the markets, trade, regulations, or disease. The worldwide shortage of computer chips will impact all aspects of agriculture for the next two years and beyond… farm equipment manufacturers have halted shipments to dealers because they don’t have the chips to put in the equipment… not only have combine, planter, tillage, and tractor sales been impacted, but even ATV supplies are limited. Parts, even non-electric parts, are also in short supply because the manufacturers of those parts use the chips in the manufacturing process. As farmers integrate technology into all aspects of the farming process, these highly sophisticated semiconductors have become the backbone of almost every farming operation.” 
<br />
<br />Rabobank’s Global Economics &amp; Markets desk commented on the Hoosier Ag Today report and cautioned on the “technological wonders of a global economy based on just-in-time supplies of a few key inputs from only a few locations; and then demand surged due a virus that ran rampant through said global economy; and supply chains got snarled for that, and other reasons; and now a lack of silicon chips even impacts on the price of potato chips (in the US) and chips (in the UK).” 
<br />
<br />The shortage has caused Reynolds Farm Equipment, one of Indiana’s largest John Deere dealers, to inform customers that order times are unknown at the moment because production for specific equipment has been disrupted because of the lack of chips. 
<br />
<br />Bane Welker Equipment, which carries Case farm equipment and several other notable brands with dealerships in Indiana and Ohio, urged customers to plan ahead. The dealership warned customers that combine harvesters, planters, tillages, and tractor supplies have been limited because of the chip shortage. They even said ATV supplies are limited. All of this has severely dented sales for the dealership. 
<br />
<br />Farmers have been rapidly integrating technology into the farming process for the last decade. Agricultural technology has enabled farmers to produce higher crop yields, decrease water, fertilizer, and pesticides, which keeps food prices down and saves the environment. Though as Rabobank described earlier when chips go missing the technological wonders of a global economy come crashing down. 
<br />
<br />“In the U.S., we love our quick-fix solutions, which usually involve federal government bailouts. This time, however, that solution will not work to solve the shortage,” said Hoosier Ag Today.

									Animal Rebellion is at again!  No meat, no cheese!
<br />______
<br />
<br />Animal rights activists block McDonald’s distribution centres in UK, demanding 100% ‘plant-based’ menu
<br />
<br />An animal rights organisation known as Animal Rebellion attempted to shut down McDonald’s distribution centres in the UK with bamboo structures, vans, and other obstacles, demanding that the company go completely vegan.
<br />
<br />The organisation announced on Saturday that around 50 activists were blocking four distribution centres in Coventry, Basingstoke, Heywood, and Hemel Hempstead, and would continue to do so for at least 24 hours.
<br />
<br />Videos show the activists hanging from bamboo structures in front of the gates as one woman issued the demand that McDonald’s “go plant-based immediately.” A McDonald’s sign and burger sculpture were also drenched in blood by the activists, while placards protested the fast food company’s use of both meat and dairy – signalling that a plant-based menu could not include burger staples like cheese.

									Oregon approves blackouts (PSPS - Public Safety Power Shutoffs) California style! This is economic warfare, bad for farms/ranches, unhealthy for people, and so on:
<br /> 
<br />PORTLAND, Ore. — The Oregon Public Utility Commission has approved a set of temporary rules for the upcoming 2021 wildfire season, including controlled blackouts, otherwise referred to as &#34;public safety power shutoffs&#34; (PSPS). The rules cover the use of shutoffs, as well as utility reporting requirements.
<br />
<br />While it&#39;s a common measure taken in California during fire season, the use of PSPS is relatively new in Oregon. The first time the state saw one was in September of 2020 when thousands of residents near Mt. Hood had their power cut by Portland General Electric when fire risk became high with hot and windy conditions--branches and debris coming into contact with power lines could spark a blaze.
<br />
<br />The PUC said the power shutoff measure was a last resort, but one provided until &#34;more expansive permanent rules are further developed.&#34;
<br />
<br />A PSPS is a measure of last resort, designed to help keep people and communities in high fire-risk areas safe by proactively shutting off electricity during extreme and dangerous weather conditions when energized electrical lines could be damaged and ignite a fast-moving wildfire.
<br />
<br />The temporary rules for wildfire season will be in effect through mid-November 2021. They establish rules for how utility companies communicate and coordinate a PSPS and require that notifications are issued before, during and after a potential outage.

<br />CDC warns Americans not to hug, kiss chickens amid salmonella outbreak
<br />
<br />ATLANTA - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is cautioning Americans not to &#34;kiss or snuggle backyard poultry&#34; out of concern of growing salmonella cases linked to chickens. 
<br />
<br />The agency issued the warning Thursday on its website. Salmonella are bacteria that come from contaminated food or environment. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps and begin within six hours and last for up to seven days. Symptoms usually clear up without the aid of antibiotics, according to the CDC.

									Blake Lovewell&#39;s article summarizes a lot about the hostile takeover of food production -- from Rockefeller &#34;Reset the Table&#34; to Biobots to food as medicine / edible vaccines.  I imagine this could be a good primer for folks:
<br />
<br />_____
<br />Get Ready for the ‘Plate Reset’
<br />
<br />&#34;In July 2020, the Rockefeller Foundation released a paper entitled ‘Reset the Table: Meeting the Moment to Transform the U.S. Food System’. This outlines their wide-ranging plans for the global food system; from farm to mouth they have a plan to ‘Reset the table’ (although I prefer our moniker – The Plate Reset). I encourage you to give it a look, though it is more than a mealy mouthful to try and digest. Let us look through the main aims; they call each of them a ‘Shift’ perhaps a testament to the ‘nudge’ theory of psychological manipulation that is the main tool of government today, whereby wholesale change is achieved by imperceptible small changes.
<br />
<br />As I surmise them, these shifts are:
<br />
<br />To Integrate the ‘food system’ under one political aegis
<br />To Collectivise and centralise control of the supply of food
<br />To engender ‘Prosperity’ – i.e. to enrich the stakeholders&#34;
<br />
<br />...

<br />Full disclosure that I work for <a href="https://Rareseeds.com" rel="noopener">Rareseeds.com</a> but do not officially represent them here.  I personally don’t care who you buy seeds from as long as they are heirloom and non-GMO.
<br />
<br />It is imperative that you think about your remaining 2021 and 2022 food supply needs and buy seeds now.  We are quadrupling capacity just to meet demand and supply chain issues.  The majority of fall seed purchases start mid-August.  You should shift your thinking way forward on that.

									This plan really sucks.  
<br />  &#34;... halt the climate crisis by 2050 ...&#34;

<br />Trials to suck carbon dioxide from the air to start across the UK [Guardian]
<br />A major £30m project will test trees, peat, rock chips, and charcoal as ways of removing climate-heating emissions
<br />
<br />Climate-heating carbon dioxide will be sucked from the air using trees, peat, rock chips, and charcoal in major new trials across the UK.
<br />
<br />Scientists said the past failure to rapidly cut emissions means some CO2 will need to be removed from the atmosphere to reach net zero by 2050 and halt the climate crisis. The £30m project funded by UK Research and Innovation will test ways to do this effectively and affordably on over 100 hectares (247 acres) of land, making it one of the biggest trials in the world.
<br />
<br />Degraded peatlands will be re-wetted and replanted in the Pennines and west Wales, while rock chips that absorb CO2 as they break down in soil will be tested on farms in Devon, Hertfordshire and mid-Wales. Special charcoal called biochar will be buried at a sewage disposal site, on former mine sites and railway embankments.
<br />
<br />The best large-scale ways to use trees to capture carbon will also be examined across the UK, including on Ministry of Defence and National Trust land. The last trial will measure the carbon removal potential of energy crops such as willow and miscanthus grass for the first time at commercial scale. These crops would be burned for energy, with the CO2 emissions trapped and stored underground.
<br />
<br />“This is seriously exciting and pretty much world leading,” said Prof Cameron Hepburn, at the University of Oxford and who is leading the coordination of the trials. “Nobody really wants to be in the situation of having to suck so much CO2 from the atmosphere. But that’s where we are – we’ve delayed [climate action] for too long.”
<br />
<br />He emphasised that cutting emissions from fossil fuel burning as fast as possible remains vital to tackling global heating: “There’s no suggestion that [CO2 removal] is a substitute for reducing our emissions.”
<br />
<br />Scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have concluded there is no way of keeping the global temperature rise to the internationally agreed target of 1.5C without both cutting emissions and removing billions of tonnes of CO2 a year by 2050. The UK’s official climate advisers estimate the UK is likely to need to remove about 100m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2050 to reach net zero.
<br />
<br />Carbon removal is also deemed essential because it will be difficult to halt all emissions from sectors such as aviation, farming and cement by 2050. The new trials are part of a £110m government programme that also includes trials of using technology to scrub CO2 directly from the air.

									US Spring Wheat is in Record Worst condition.
<br />
<br />I have to be honest, my friends, im running out of words. 
<br />
<br />You see food prices exploding based on crop losses from previous seasons.
<br />
<br />We see this season already quite poor: drought, no GDD (also known as COLD) - reflected in wheat crop condition and in how much corn/soybeans have EMERGED (ie, anyone can plant, but is it growing?).
<br />
<br />This will translate to poor yields - and much of this year’s not-yet-grown crop has already been pre-sold to China!
<br />
<br />US supplies are exhausted. Engineered problems ahead.

<br />There’s currently a nationwide deficit of both long-haul and short-run truck drivers, and it will impact the transit of feed, fuel, bulk milk and processed dairy products – if it hasn’t already.
<br />
<br />Economists with American Trucking Associations (ATA) predict a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers nationwide by 2023.

Dr. Leroy outlines with studied precision the UN Food Systems Summit: the agenda to end traditional farming and ranching, the players involved (and the revolving door between big multinational food companies, think tanks/foundations, and policymakers), the movement&#39;s genesis in new age &#34;Gaia&#34; worship, and much, much more.

									After the frost, fruit and vegetable producers now have to deal with the rain. In the Moselle, producers cannot plant anything and delays are accumulating.
<br />
<br />According to Vincent Neveux, producer in Norroy-le-Veneur, “Two days without rain are needed for the soil to be dry enough. At this pace, all the vegetables are going to arrive at the same time on the shelves, in large quantities.”
<br />
<br />Nearly 4,000 plants are already in storage. In order to avoid any loss, the producer has put his lettuce, celeriac and celery plants in a dark and dry place so that they do not grow too fast.
<br />
<br />In Peltre, the strawberry harvest, already delayed by three weeks, is suffering from the lack of sun and the cold temperatures. “We are worried about the sun not coming out,” explains producer Vincent Tillement. “Already, the first strawberries clearly have less sugar and less flavor.”

									Ireland - Heavy rain and hail disrupts crops
<br />
<br />All over Europe the weather has been unseasonal for the last couple of months, cold and dry in April and then very wet throughout May.
<br />
<br />Ireland has been no exception, with 64mm of rain falling in four days last week and before that localised but very severe hail.
<br />
<br />“We lost 10 hectares of crops, mainly spinach and baby leaf,” said Stephen McCormack from McCormack Family farms in Co. Meath. “It was bad but very localised and our other farms were all fine, so I was relieved.”

									#India:  COVID lockdowns mean farmers have no place to sell their crops:
<br />
<br />&#39;&#39;Production was good this year but with no market, we have to throw our produce away.,&#34; said Shabir Ahmad, a farmer.
<br />
<br />Another Strawberry farmer said that even during last year&#39;s Covid lockdown, they managed to sell strawberries to locals but this year people are very scared to even venture out of their homes. This in turn has narrowed their scope of selling strawberries even to locals.
<br />
<br />Sources said the farmers are completely on their own and have time and again approached the government for cold storage for strawberries as the fruit has a low shelf life.
<br />
<br />&#34;We request the government to at least make a cold storage or make a policy like they have for saffron or orchards or cherries. Last year, we had around 100 hectares of land utilised for strawberry farming but this year it was only 70-8,&#34; added Manzoor Ahmad, a strawberry Farmer.

									There&#39;s the Guardian for you - pushing for new rules for insects as food in UK :  &#34;With their minimal environmental footprint and excellent nutritional profile, insects are seen as a more sustainable form of protein than conventional meat and fish.&#34;
<br />
<br />&#34;It sounds like a case of the left hand not knowing what the right is doing. Millions of pounds of public funds, for example through Innovate UK, have gone towards the development of insect-based food. Yet, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) is now hindering its very development,” she said.
<br />
<br />Di Costanzo, who sells her products online to high-end restaurants and also runs insect cooking classes, says the FSA hasn’t indicated whether it planned product recalls.
<br />
<br />“We have written to the environment secretary George Eustice, and in the public interest, we would welcome a discussion about this: the fact that more than two billion people regularly consume more than 2,000 species of edible insects should be evidence to review the novel food classification,” she said.

									Robots, artificial intelligence to guide Australia’s first fully automated farm
<br />
<br />Robots and artificial intelligence will replace workers on Australia&#39;s first fully automated farm created at a cost of $20 million.
<br />
<br />Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga will create the &#34;hands-free farm&#34; on a 1,900-hectare property to demonstrate what robots and artificial intelligence can do without workers in the paddock. 
<br />
<br />Food Agility chief executive Richard Norton said the reality of &#34;hands-free&#34; farming&#39; was closer than many people realised.
<br />
<br />&#34;Full automation is not a distant concept. We already have mines in the Pilbara operated entirely through automation&#34;, he said

									Water, farm labor, shipping containers, truck drivers — it&#39;s as though everything that&#39;s not actual food is coming up short for local agricultural producers these days. And now this: They&#39;re running low on pallets, too. 
<br />
<br />An inadequate supply of wooden pallets, the squat structures used to make shipments easier to move with a forklift, has hit the industry just ahead of the grape harvest, raising concerns that farmers&#39; profits could be lost to packaging expenses — or worse, lead to a produce shortage. 
<br />
<br />Growers say the dearth is exacerbating runaway costs. There&#39;s only so much local ag companies can do to lower their exposure to what he described as a severe pallet crunch. Price quotes aren&#39;t lasting more than a week before they go up again, he stated.
<br />
<br />The confluence of ag-related shortages has exacerbated the industry&#39;s various and pressing challenges.
<br />
<br />The drought, combined with restrictions on groundwater pumping, has strained irrigation practices just as a longstanding shortage of farmworkers has stretched growers&#39; ability to attend to their crops.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, the pandemic has contributed to port congestion, increasing shipping costs and delaying overseas deliveries. Another outgrowth of the coronavirus crisis has been a dramatic worsening of the nationwide shortage of truckers able to make deliveries. <a href="https://www.bakersfield.com/news/ags-latest-headache-a-shortage-of-pallets-for-shipping-produce/article_bbcc2b38-ba6c-11eb-8bbe-1bcd995b662d.html" rel="noopener">https://www.bakersfield.com/news/ags-latest-headache-a-shortage-of-pallets-for-shipping-produce/article_bbcc2b38-ba6c-11eb-8bbe-1bcd995b662d.html</a>
