									African Swine Fever reaches Americas - Threatens #1 Pork Exporter, USA
<br />
<br />African Swine Fever, which destroyed 70% of China&#39;s pork, has been confirmed in the Americas. Though the USDA assures us all is well due to new biosecurity measures, failures to contain ASF in China, Germany, and elsewhere suggest otherwise. Could this lead to the shutdown of the #1 pork exporter in the world - and do unimaginable damage to farmers in the USA? Is traditional farming and ranching really too dirty and dangerous to continue, or is this part of the war on meat?  Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

									Bacon (all pork) may disappear in California as pig rules take effect
<br />
<br />At the beginning of next year, California will begin enforcing an animal welfare proposition approved overwhelmingly by voters in 2018 that requires more space for breeding pigs, egg-laying chickens and veal calves. National veal and egg producers are optimistic they can meet the new standards, but only 4% of hog operations now comply with the new rules. Unless the courts intervene or the state temporarily allows non-compliant meat to be sold in the state, California will lose almost all of its pork supply, much of which comes from Iowa, and pork producers will face higher costs to regain a key market.

											<p>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Thanks to a reworked menu and long hours, Jeannie Kim managed to keep her San Francisco restaurant alive during the coronavirus pandemic. That makes it all the more frustrating that she fears her breakfast-focused diner could be ruined within months by new rules that could make one of her top menu items — bacon — hard to get in California.</p>

									As mentioned in the ASF report - China has rebuilt their herd not with smaller farmers, but with indoor, tech-driven operations:
<br />
<br />China Is Putting Pigs In 13-Storey &#34;Hog Hotels&#34; To Keep Germs Out
<br />
<br />China is taking hog biosecurity to new levels -- 13 stories in fact.
<br />That&#39;s the height of a building in southern China where more than 10,000 pigs are kept in a condominium-style complex, complete with restricted access, security cameras, in-house veterinary services and carefully prepared meals.
<br />
<br />The seemingly luxurious conditions represent a state-of-the-art approach to biosecurity in which pigs -- the main source of meat in China -- are shielded from viruses, including the devastating African swine fever that wiped out half the nation&#39;s hogs in the two years before the coronavirus pandemic emerged.
<br />
<br />Nicknamed &#34;hog hotels,&#34; these gigantic vertical farms are being built by companies, including Muyuan Foods and New Hope Group, emulating the strict controls major suppliers in other countries have used to prevent outbreaks of the devastating disease.
<br />
<br />China is copying best-practices from Europe and the U.S. to close its biosecurity gap, said Rupert Claxton, the U.K.-based meat director at consultant Gira, who has been providing advice to farmers and businesses for two decades. &#34;In 20 years, it&#39;s done what the Americans took probably 100 years to do,&#34; he said.
<br />
<br />Lethal African swine fever, which sickens pigs much like Ebola kills humans, caused a dramatic outbreak in China in 2018. Within a year, roughly half the nation&#39;s herd of more than 400 million pigs had been wiped out -- more than the entire annual output of the U.S. and Brazil combined -- leading to rocketing prices and unprecedented imports.
<br />
<br />Top Priority
<br />
<br />Food security became a top priority, and as inflation surged to the highest in eight years, the government had to turn to emergency sources of frozen meat to cool prices. New agriculture policies were instituted to accelerate a shift to large-scale, industrial operations over backyard farms that have traditionally fattened pigs on raw kitchen scraps and swill -- the main sources of African swine fever.
<br />
<br />Now, domestic hog numbers recovered more swiftly than anticipated because mega farms have expanded capacity so aggressively. Wholesale pork prices have tumbled so much that it tripped the government&#39;s new alert system, prompting authorities to begin buying pork for state reserves and to shore up the market.

									STUNNING!  UK to monitor supermarket spending, offer &#34;free treats for lifestyle habits&#34; 
<br />- this is already turning into incentives for human capital -- good behavior plugs straight into your social credit score, impacting food selection.
<br />- what you buy is no longer your business !  
<br />
<br />____
<br />Families could get rewards for healthy living in new war on obesity
<br />
<br />Lifestyle habits such as taking part in a regular run or walking to school daily could be linked to free treats in pilot scheme
<br />
<br />Boris Johnson is to launch a government-backed rewards programme for families switching to healthier food and exercising under radical plans to tackle Britain&#39;s obesity crisis.
<br />
<br />The scheme will monitor family supermarket spending, rewarding those who reduce their calorie intake and buy more fruit and vegetables. People increasing their exercise by taking part in organised events or walking to school will also accumulate extra &#34;points&#34; in a new app.
<br />
<br />On Friday night, Lord Stevens, the outgoing head of the NHS, warned that the health service would struggle struggle to cope in future if there were not radical moves to tackle obesity.
<br />
<br />Under the new plan, &#34;loyalty points&#34; accumulated would be exchanged for discounts, free tickets or other incentives.
<br />
<br />The scheme is to be launched in January and underlines Mr Johnson&#39;s determination to tackle growing levels of obesity. The Prime Minister blamed his weight for his serious illness with Covid last year.

									Australia&#39;s Bumper crop under threat from harvest worker shortage
<br />
<br />(Even when it&#39;s not the weather, it&#39;s the lockdowns!)
<br />__
<br />After battling through years of drought farmers across the country are being rewarded with a second year of above-average rainfall, but a lack of harvest workers is threatening to derail the bumper crop.
<br />
<br />A large crop requires a large workforce to operate machinery, drive trucks and manage the large network of grain terminals across regional Australia.
<br />
<br />Usually, skilled workers from the Northern Hemisphere would travel to Australia to work on the harvest.
<br />
<br />During the last 18 months, thousands of those workers have left the country and borders have not yet reopened.
<br />
<br />Rod Gribble, president of the Australian Custom Harvesters Association, said the situation for his members was dire.
<br />
<br />&#34;Our members have been advertising for months and months but there&#39;s just no skilled operators around,&#34; Mr Gribble said. 
<br />
<br />Mr Gribble said millions of dollars worth of crops could be lost in adverse weather if crops are not harvested on time.
<br />
<br />&#34;That&#39;s mega, mega millions of dollars lost,&#34; he said.

									Grasshoppers Finish off North Dakota Crops, Pastures Already Plagued by Drought
<br />
<br />&#34;In my 25 years of farming and ranching  I&#39;ve  never seen anything like this,&#34; says Steeke. &#34;They&#39;re eating it down to nothing. You can see my 300 acres of barley, all you can see is they&#39;ve eaten it to the ground. There&#39;s nothing left.&#34;
<br />
<br />In a normal year, Steeke would get 1500-3000 bales on a thousand acre field. This year, he got 53. 
<br />
<br />&#34;It&#39;s just historically one of the worst things that we&#39;ve ever been through,&#34; says Steeke.

<br />
<br />California plays a crucial role in the food economy, producing more than 80 percent of the country’s wine and more than 80 percent of fruits like strawberries and raspberries. If [AS] a lack of fire insurance helps usher these farmers out of business, the rest of the country might pay for it at the grocery store.&#34;

									As of this writing, some four commercial, patrol, and research vessels have been disabled — one of which may have been hijacked — in the main shipping channel through the Strait of Hormuz, apparently as part of an Iranian military operation. 
<br />
<br />If this turns out to be accurate, the Islamic Republic has attempted to use sea mines to close the strait and so to strangle the flow of petroleum to global markets in the most dramatic offensive escalation in this vital shipping way since 1988. The timing of the action is no accident, as last month, Iran announced it would be making its first oil shipment from its new terminal at Jask Port on the Gulf of Oman — its first such facility south of Hormuz. Few took notice at the time, but Tehran was in essence signaling that it no longer needs the strait to supply clients, notably the People’s Republic of China. Now the world will be forced to take notice as the mullahs are foot-stomping this new capability.

									Big banks buying up &amp; shutting down energy infrastructure
<br />&#34;Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!&#34;
<br />
<br />The British insurer Prudential is working with the Asian Development Bank on a scheme to buy out coal-fired power plants in Asia in order to shut them down within 15 years.
<br />
<br />Its backers say the plan is designed to limit use of the polluting fossil fuel while allowing workers time to find new jobs and incentivising countries to invest in clean energy alternatives.
<br />
<br />“The world cannot possibly hit the Paris climate targets unless we accelerate the retirement and replacement of existing coal-fired electricity, opening up much larger room in the near term for renewables and storage,” Kanak said.

											<p>California, along with essentially all of the American West, is experiencing a period of extreme drought, and during an extreme drought, water is precious. On Tuesday, California’s State Water Resources Control Board voted to institute a curtailment in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed, reports Julia Wick of the Los Angeles Times. The curtailment will dramatically reduce, and sometimes eliminate, the ability of big chunks of California’s Central Valley from using river and stream water for agriculture.  California’s system of water rights is labyrinthine and based in large part on seniority. The owners of land that includes those most senior water</p>

									Potato shortage could blight Britain as demand for potatoes grows in Europe
<br />Heavy floods have seen spud prices soar on the continent
<br />
<br />The UK could experience a shortage of chips as the demand for potatoes grows in Europe.
<br />
<br />After heavy flooding last month, the price of spuds has soared on the continent and buyers are targeting Britain, the Daily Star reported.
<br />
<br />A &#34;perfect storm&#34; of inflation, labour shortages, environmental disaster, Brexit, rising fuel and distribution costs, has caused the problem.
<br />
<br />But this has been added to by the continuing impact of Covid, triggering food shortages and spiralling bills, Lynx Purchasing reported.
<br />
<br />Frozen chips will be among the first to go with a leap in prices likely and our Christmas roasties are also under threat.

									French wine production falls to ‘historically low’ level after vineyards devastated by severe frost
<br />
<br />France’s agriculture ministry reported on Friday that it has experienced one of the worst years on record for wine production, as a devastating late-spring frost sent output to “historically low” levels not seen since 1977.
<br />
<br />The impact of the damaging frosts is expected to result in the nation, which is the second-largest wine producer globally, seeing its output fall to the “historically low” level of 24 to 30% in 2021. This would put it at a level below that of 1991 and 2017, when output was significantly hampered by a similar late-spring frost that destroyed harvests.
<br />
<br />“For now, it looks like the yield will be comparable to that of 1977 – a year when the vine harvest was reduced by both destructive frost and summer downpours,” the Agricultural Ministry’s statement read.

									United Nations intent on shutting down Australia with a meat production tax
<br />
<br />UN meat tax will close down Australia’s cattle industry and starve 80 million people, says Bob Katter
<br />__
<br />Bob Katter MHR, says a carbon tax on meat, which has been proposed at a United Nations food summit, would shut down Australia’s cattle industry and starve 80 million people alone.
<br />
<br />The True Animal Price Protein Coalition proposed a meat tax of a €1 ($1.61) per kilo, at the summit in Rome last week of which Australia is a major sponsor, having contributed $63.9m.
<br />
<br />“Almost every single calf that is born in Australia is produced on land that can’t be used for any other purpose,” Mr Katter said.
<br />
<br />“I’m not talking about fattening country; I’m talking about breeding country where the cattle are bred. If you introduce that tax and wipe out the cattle industry, then there is 2.4 billion kilos of protein that will no longer be available (Australia on an average year turns off 8 million cattle for consumption, each with 300 kgs of consumable meat). The average family of five eats 150 kg of beef a year,[2] so you are going to starve 80 million people to satisfy your ideology.
<br />
<br />“There is no alternative feedstock that can provide such an enormously high protein regime.  The staple diets in Indonesia, Europe, Japan, South Korea and South America is meat. You’ve got to eat a lot of rice to get the same protein content that beef provides.”

									MILLERS, BAKERS FRET AS DROUGHT WITHERS NORTH AMERICA’S SPRING WHEAT
<br />
<br />Millers and bakers are draining wheat reserves and paying more for spring wheat used in baking, as drought shrivels crops across the Canadian Prairies and northern U.S. Plains that produce more than half of the world’s supply.
<br />
<br />U.S. and Canadian farmers are bracing for a sharply smaller spring wheat harvest due to the driest conditions in decades, as severe weather damages crops across the hemisphere, from heat scorching cherries in the U.S. Pacific Northwest to frost chilling sugarcane in Brazil.
<br />
<br />While overall global wheat stocks are large, the drought affects mainly the high-protein spring wheat crop that millers such as Archer Daniels Midland Co and bakers including Grupo Bimbo rely on to produce the texture and moistness in baked goods that consumers expect.
<br />
<br />Importers from Britain to China must pay up for limited North American harvests or turn to other suppliers like Australia and Russia.
<br />
<br />Minneapolis spring wheat futures are trading near nine-year highs, leaving Camas Country Mill in Eugene, Oregon, braced to pay more, said owner Tom Hunton. He plans on passing his higher costs on to the mill’s bakery customers.

									McDonald&#39;s Pressured By Dwlinding Food Bag Supplies
<br />
<br />[IAF: Somehow it&#39;s always the parts of the supply chain you don&#39;t think about that cause disruptions]
<br />
<br />The latest supply chain challenge to hit McDonald&#39;s Corp. is the lack of paper bags for food orders. The chain told restaurant owners to limit their bag orders from suppliers as usage is above seasonal trends, according to an internal message from the fast-food company, seen by The Wall Street Journal. 
<br />
<br />McDonald&#39;s said customers who dine inside are demanding Big Macs, McNuggets, and fries be served in bags rather than trays which have compounded the tightness of the paper bag supplies.

									Sugar CEO Says Wild Weather Will Extend Sweetener’s Price Boom
<br />
<br />The worst weather in decades in top sugar exporter Brazil will have a lasting impact on global sweetener prices that are already near four-year highs, according to the world’s second-largest producer.
<br />
<br />Sugar has been rising on concern that severe frosts and the worst drought in nearly a century in the South American nation will lead to significant losses in sugar production, exacerbating an already tight global supply outlook. The extreme weather has also boosted coffee prices and is fueling global food-inflation worries.

									Farmers May Cull 130,000 Hogs as Quebec Strike Halts Pork Plant
<br />
<br />Farmers may have to euthanize and dispose of more than 130,000 hogs in eastern Canada as a months-long strike at a pork processor leaves a backlog of animals.
<br />
<br />Olymel’s processing facility in Vallee-Jonction, Quebec, which usually slaughters 36,000 hogs each week, has been shut since April 28, when employees walked out. The company has been sending some of the animals to the U.S. and western Canada, an alternative that still leaves 15,000 pigs behind every week, according to David Duval, the president of the Eleveurs de porcs du Quebec, which represents the province’s producers.

									#Tyson Employees protest the company&#39;s mandatory vaccine policy
<br />
<br />Tyson announced last week that all of their 120,000 employees nationwide will need to be vaccinated by Nov. 1 unless they are exempted for medical or religious reasons. Around half of the company&#39;s employees are currently vaccinated, while front-line employees who receive the jab are eligible for a $200 bonus and up to four hours of pay if they are inoculated outside of work. 
<br />
<br />The protest comes one week after the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union raised objections to to the mandate because the vaccine has not been fully approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). [IAF: that will happen soon enough -- why not individual sovereingty?]

									China purchases of US food continue: 
<br />
<br />China bought 600 tons of U.S. pork last week, well below the more than 18,000 tons from the previous week, but still a positive sign for demand after being out of the market for about a month. China also bought 1,000 tons of U.S. beef, along with good amounts of old crop sorghum and old and new crop soybeans. Old crop corn exports were up sharply on the week and new crop sales were solid as the reality of Brazil’s much smaller than expected second corn crop starts to take hold.

									South Korea Reports African Swine Fever on Large Commercial Pig Farm
<br />
<br />A South Korea pig farm with 2,400 pigs confirmed an outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) on Sunday. The country is on high alert to contain the spread of this deadly virus just three months after the latest confirmed case on May 4. 
<br />
<br />According to the Korea Herald, the government-led ASF task force announced that the ASF case was confirmed at a domesticated pig farm in Goseong-gun, Gangwon Province. This farm is the only pig farm in a three-kilometer radius. There are two other farms with a combined 3,100 pigs in a 10-kilometer radius.
<br />
<br />To date, South Korea has confirmed 18 cases of ASF at local pig farms since the outbreak started in September 2019. Authorities culled more than 450,000 farmed pigs culled across 14 pig farms in the first 30 days. Counting wild boars, ASF has been confirmed in a total of 1,517 cases.

									New plan slows Lake Mead decline by paying farms not to plant crops
<br />
<br />Officials in Lower Colorado River Basin states want to slow the decline of Lake Mead’s water levels over the next few years by paying Southern California farmers not to plant crops.
<br />
<br />It’s not a plan that Bill Hasencamp, manager of Colorado River resources for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, considers a “drought buster,” but it will reduce lake level decline by up to 3 feet over the next three years, he said.

									Yet another port closure in China &#34;due to COVID&#34; to further disrupt global shipping and container prices:
<br />
<br />We recently discussed how already astronomical container shipping costs are set to rise even higher should China lock down one or more shipping terminals to contain the spread of the delta variant in provinces that have direct exposure to global commerce (&#34;Shipping Rates From China To US Hit Record $20,000 With No Drop In Sight&#34; and &#34;Brace For Astronomical Shipping Costs As China Goes Into Lockdown Mode&#34;) with Goldman Sachs explicitly warning that &#34;port closures or stricter control measures at ports could also put further upward pressure on shipping costs, which are already very high.&#34;
<br />
<br />It now looks that this worst case scenario is in play after Chinese authorities on Wednesday closed a major container terminal at the Port of Ningbo after a dock worker tested positive for COVID, raising fears among traders that supply chain disruptions that occurred when Yantian terminal in Shenzhen reduced output by 70% for a month earlier this summer would be repeated.

									GRAPHENE IN FOOD?
<br />
<br />Researchers at Rice University successfully used a commercial laser to transform the surface carbon in foods–like toast, coconuts shells, potatoes, and Girl Scout cookies–into graphene!
<br />
<br />“Perhaps all food will have a tiny RFID tag that gives you information about where it’s been, how long it’s been stored, its country and city of origin, and the path it took to get to your table.”
<br />
<br />Further: “In the future, much of what we eat could contain a complete interactive layer that we can barely even envision right now. (Think of a literal apple that puts 1,000 songs in your pocket.)
<br />
<br />[IAF: The real direction of this “augmented reality” layer is behavioral — think healthy snacks vs sweets that affect your health/social credit score &amp; incentives ]

									Nigeria: poultry industry collapsing as soybeans/corn short, no animal feed:
<br />
<br />“The Poultry industry is currently in dire straits, forcing many farms and hatcheries to go underground. 
<br />
<br />Those still operating are either struggling to remain in business at zero profit or incurring huge debts to stay afloat.
<br />
<br />High cost of poultry feeds has been identified as the main factor crippling the poultry sector, as shortage of soybean; a major ingredient used in poultry feeds hits the country.
<br />
<br />The price hike of this produce has been linked to shortage of maize, majorly due to the ban placed on its importation. According to experts, soybean is completely not available in the country today. Its supply has fallen steeply in recent months, due to insecurity that has put farmers off work last year, COVID-19 disruption, weather changes, and challenges with importation.

									NOT A DRILL - worldwide food supply is reaching critical levels:
<br />
<br />&#34;EU wheat, barley harvest losses create ‘explosive’ world supply outlook – analyst&#34;
<br />
<br />PARIS, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Adverse weather in the European Union has sharply reduced prospects for wheat and barley harvests, contributing to a potentially &#39;explosive&#39; global supply outlook for the cereals, analyst firm Strategie Grains said.
<br />
<br />In a monthly report, the French firm reduced its forecast for 2021 soft wheat production in the 27-country EU by 1.5 million tonnes to 131.5 million tonnes.
<br />
<br />Wet weather in the run-up to harvesting had led to disappointing yields in France and Germany while high temperatures in June had lowered yields in Poland and northern Europe, Strategie Grains said.
<br />
<br />The revised EU soft wheat crop forecast would nonetheless be 12.7 million tonnes above Strategie Grains&#39; estimate of last year&#39;s output.
<br />
<br />But the downgrade comes as harvest prospects have also deteriorated in other exporting zones like North America and the Black Sea region.
<br />
<br />Strategie Grains reduced its projection of world wheat production, including durum, by 14 million tonnes to 750.3 million tonnes.
<br />
<br />The share of livestock feed-grade crop in the soft wheat harvest was expected to be higher than last year, reflecting the impact of heavy rain, it said.
<br />
<br />Projected EU barley production was lowered by 2 million tonnes from July to 53.0 million tonnes, contributing to a 7 million tonne cut to Strategie Grains&#39; forecast of global barley output.
<br />
<br />With drought ravaging crops in major exporter Canada, the market was facing &#34;explosive situations for barley and wheat&#34;, putting the onus on maize (corn) to pick up additional demand for livestock feed, it said.
<br />
<br />[IAF: ... yet the USDA is lowering it&#39;s US export numbers, even as yields fall across the world -- where are these grains going to come from?  Food prices are going to continue to rise, absolutely exploding over next 18mo]

									Construction is under way at Melbourne’s Centre for National Resilience – the unwieldy name given to the new quarantine facility in Mickleham – with the camp set to open by the end of the year.
<br />
<br />A community engagement session was held earlier this week on progress of the fast-tracked 1000-bed accommodation site for returning travellers, however residents were told that builders would not be delayed by any consultation process.
<br />
<br />Earthworks have begun at an empty paddock in Melbourne’s north, which sits next to the federal government’s pet quarantine facility and is about 300 metres from homes.

									Hay shortage - rising feed costs - animals being liquidated :
<br />
<br />BOZEMAN — The state of Montana has been experiencing a hay shortage, introducing concerns of supply, price, and ‘out-of-state’ problems.
<br />
<br />“In May we had really high temperatures, then we went to below freezing temperatures, then back up to 90 degrees for the last two months,” Ty Kraft said.
<br />
<br />“We had to raise our prices just to make all our payments and make everything work out,” Kraft said.

									Taiwan: agricultural losses hit nearly NT$577 million due to heavy rains
<br />
<br />TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Heavy rains over the past few weeks have caused an estimated NT$576.84 million (US$20.71 million) in damage to crops as of Sunday morning (Aug. 15).
<br />Recent torrential rains have mostly affected farmers living in the central and southern parts of the nation, with those in Chiayi County experiencing around NT$125.32 million in losses. Kaohsiung City followed with an estimated NT$106.46 million in crop damages, while Nantou County also lost out on around NT$105.99 million, COA figures showed.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, Pingtung County had an estimated NT$65.35 million in crop losses, followed by Yunlin County at NT$54.18 million. 
<br />
<br />Changhua County also recorded NT$46.07 million in damages and Tainan City reported about NT$42.41 in agricultural damage.
<br />According to the COA, around 8,551 hectares of crops were damaged in total. Growers of papaya, guava, peanuts, dragon fruit, and longan were the most affected.
<br />
<br />Livestock farmers also were hit with around NT$8.17 million in losses, with poultry farmers losing around 104,000 chickens valued at NT$4.55 million. Duck, pig, and geese farmers suffered the remainder of the livestock losses.

									BIG FOOD COMPANIES RUSH TO FAKE FISH
<br />
<br />Alternative seafood is one of the fastest growing segments of the plant-based market. Think: tuna made from tomatoes, and artichoke crab cakes [IAF: not to mention lab-grown cell-cultured nonsense!]. Investment in US plant-based seafood hit $70M in the first half of 2021 — as much as in the past two years combined. But it still makes up only $12M, or 0.1% of the $15B US seafood market. That’s partly because real seafood has a strong health halo.
<br />
<br />* Tyson invested in plant-based shellfish company New Wave Foods, which launched its seaweed based shrimp this year.
<br />* Nestle launched Vuna, a plant-based tuna alternative, last year. It cited stats that 90% of global fish stocks are now fully or nearly depleted.
<br />* Thai Union Group, which owns tuna legend Chicken of the Sea, already makes plant-based fish and crab, and plans to launch plant-based shrimp this year.

									U.S. declares first Western reservoir water shortage, triggering cuts
<br />
<br />WATER SHORTAGES OUT WEST
<br />
<br />From Reuters: Dated 8/17/2021
<br />
<br />&#34;Arizona will lose 18% of its annual apportionment, while Nevada will see cuts of 7%. Apportionments to Mexico, which are required under a 1944 treaty, will be cut by 5%.
<br />
<br />Separately, 10 Western governors urged President Joe Biden to declare a federal drought disaster in their states, qualifying farmers and ranchers to seek special assistance &#34;beyond what is available through existing emergency programs.&#34;
<br />
<br />&#34;Historic drought levels threaten to eliminate entire crops, depress yields and harbor extreme levels of pests and disease that add to the cumulative loss,&#34; the governors wrote in a letter.
<br />
<br />While not a surprise, the cuts in reservoir supplies will mean less water -- and tough allotment decisions -- for agriculture, cities and Native American tribes in the parched region, which is in its 22nd year of drought.&#34;

									Food prices are exploding, up 31% year-over-year.  You can&#39;t say Ice Age Farmer didn&#39;t warn you!
<br />
<br />___
<br />Soaring Cost of Food Is Forcing Families to Scrimp at the Dinner Table
<br />
<br />Whether at supermarkets, corner stores, or open-air markets, prices for food have been surging in much of the world, forcing families to make tough decisions about their diets. Meat is often the first to go, ceding space to less expensive proteins such as dairy, eggs, or beans. In some households, a glass of milk has become a luxury reserved only for children; fresh fruit, once deemed a necessity, is now a treat.
<br />
<br />Food prices in July were up 31% from the same month last year, according to an index compiled by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. A portion of the rise is transitory, fueled by supply chain disruption and extreme weather. Although some of the bottlenecks caused by the pandemic show signs of abating, structural factors such as climate change (indeed, blame the cow farts) and China’s strong appetite for imports will likely endure.

									FDA prepares to approve Pfizer vax without public review of data.

											<p>Transparency advocates have criticised the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) decision not to hold a formal advisory committee meeting to discuss Pfizer’s application for full approval of its covid-19 vaccine.

Last year the FDA said it was “committed to use an advisory committee composed of independent experts to ensure deliberations about authorisation or licensure are transparent for the public.”1 But in a statement, the FDA told The BMJ that it did not believe a meeting was necessary ahead of the expected granting of full approval.

“The FDA has held numerous meetings of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) related to covid-19 vaccines, including a 22 October 20202 meeting to discuss, in general, the development, authorisation, and licensure of covid-19 vaccines,” an FDA spokesperson said.

“The FDA also has held meetings of the VRBPAC on all three covid-19 vaccines authorised for emergency use and does not believe a meeting is needed related to this biologics license…</p>

									Biden Administration Demands Facebook Hand Over Data on COVID-19 Vaccine Skeptics
<br />
<br />📡@G3News: A month after Biden shockingly denounced Facebook and others as “killing people” because he thought they weren&#39;t censoring enough COVID-19 &#34;misinformation&#34; on their platforms, the Washington Post has added to the government pressure with a new article published Thursday (Aug. 19), citing three anonymous administration sources.
<br />
<br />According to the Washington Post, the White House and Facebook have held a series of meetings about turning over massive amounts of user data to the government. 
<br />
<br />The “tense” meetings saw the administration’s COVID-19 team reportedly “begging” Facebook to give them access to data showing how many people on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp see content branded as coronavirus misinformation, how many are still undecided whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine, and also the efficiency of Facebook’s censorship algorithms, i.e., how many people still get to see content that it aims to block.

									“The United Nations food systems presummit last week in Rome recommended a dietary limit of 14 grams of red meat per person per day. That’s one bite. As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I’m appalled, and I’ll explain how this is an attack on our farmers and on every Australian.
<br />
<br />“The third recommendation of the food systems presummit is to move food production within reach of population centres and produce whatever protein and nutrition is possible in that region. It’s called short chain food supply. We did it 200 years ago. People starved. Nutrition was poor. Life expectancy was less than half what we enjoy today. Then along came long chain food supply, allowing countries like Australia to grow crops to feed and clothe those in need. World hunger fell to less than 10 per cent. The only reason there are still areas of poverty and hunger in 2021 is because of war and civil unrest—you know, the things that the United Nations were supposed to solve. World peace has eluded the UN, yet cows have not. The United Nations is proposing to eliminate global food chains that have brought good food to the world for hundreds of years.

									Is a meat shortage coming to UK? Why would packers stop ordering millions of plastic trays unless this was in the works?   Any thoughts?
<br />
<br />From a contact:
<br />
<br />“I&#39;m working in a factory which makes plastic trays for meat. The factory is in Ireland, however, 80% of production goes to UK. In last 13 weeks, tray sales were going down. We have 6 machines making trays. Since the last few weeks, 2-3 machines were stopped during shifts. Next week all machines will be stopped for 3 days because our warehouse is full of pallets with production. This is the first time in recent years when machines will be down for 3 days. Usually when September approaching we had busy times. But not this year. Note. One machine during a 12-hour shift is making around 200 000-250 000 trays. So in 24 hours 6 machines making around 2.5 mln trays.

									UK: Prisoners to plug worker shortage in meat industry
<br />
<br />Abattoirs, butchers and meat processors are set to employ prisoners and ex-inmates to help plug labour shortages.
<br />
<br />Meat industry leaders held talks with the government on Monday to discuss options of how businesses could link up with prisons to fill vacancies.
<br />
<br />The Covid pandemic and Brexit have both contributed to current worker shortages, with furloughed workers finding new jobs and EU nationals returning to their home countries.
<br />
<br />The British Meat Processors Association said the current level of vacancies represented about 15% of the industry&#39;s workforce.
<br />
<br />The industry body said its members were &#34;trying absolutely every avenue&#34; to recruit workers.

									Climate change is racist meets ESG:
<br />
<br />A shareholder advocacy said on Wednesday it would rate companies based on their involvement in &#34;environmental racism,&#34; and pressure them for change.
<br />
<br />The nonprofit, As You Sow, collected and analyzed data from S&amp;P 500 companies showing what it says is the environmental impact of operations on communities of color. It said it scrutinized their products, environmental violations and fines and corporate actions.
<br />The group will initiate conversations with companies that are the worst culprits on the list and file shareholder proposals at their annual meetings next year, Olivia Knight, the group&#39;s racial justice initiative manager, said in an interview.
<br />&#34;Climate change disproportionately affects people of color and nations around the world where people of color live,&#34; Knight said.
<br />
<br />As an example, As You Sow cited Eastman Chemical, which received a poor score from As You Sow because its subsidiary owns a plant in Louisiana where there is an elevated cancer risk for residents, who are largely Black and have a per-capita annual income of $15,000, about half the national average.

									New super variant &#39;Covid-22&#39; could be even more dangerous than Delta, expert claims
<br />
<br />Immunologist Sai Reddy, of the federal technology institute ETH Zurich, said a &#34;super variant&#34; will inevitably emerge next year and new vaccinations will need to be developed for years to come.
<br />
<br />A coronavirus &#34;super variant&#34; worse than Covid-19 could emerge next year and every unvaccinated person is a potential super-spreader, according to an expert.
<br />
<br />Immunologist Professor Doctor Sai Reddy, of the federal technology institute ETH Zurich, said a combination of existing strains could result in a new and more dangerous phase of the pandemic.
<br />
<br />He warned: &#34;Covid-22 could be even worse than what we are experiencing now.&#34;
<br />
<br />As a result, multiple vaccinations will need to be prepared over the next few years as the world continues to fight the evolving threat, &#34;maybe for the rest of our lives&#34;.
<br />
<br />AND I HAVE SEVEN BRIDGES TO SELL YOU.  PEOPLE ARE SICK OF YOUR LIES.

									Engineered famine is part of the implementation script of “The Great Reset,” with the blame pegged on climate change.  Time magazine even alludes to the this explicitly in their “Time2030” piece, How we fixed the global economy:
<br />
<br />In the Midwestern U.S., a severe drought wiped out crops that supplied one-sixth of the world’s grain output. People woke up to the need for governments to form a coordinated response to climate change and direct global fiscal stimulus in support of a green economy.
<br />
<br />This was also the theme of the Soros-funded, John Podesta (Center for American Progress) Food Chain Reaction Game, which foresaw food shortages and demanded global governance over food - plus a meat tax!
<br />
<br />Start growing your own food now - prepare for this engineered crisis.

									Severe weather destroys thousands of acres of crop in Fairbank, IA
<br />
<br />Thousands of acres of corn and soybean in Fairbank were destroyed Tuesday night after severe storms rolled through eastern Iowa. A clearer picture of the scale of destruction was made clear on Wednesday.
<br />
<br />Adrienna Olson with the Buchanan County Farm Service Agency says only a few reports from Fairbank and Hazelton Township have been reported. They include corn and soybean damage.
<br />
<br />Strong winds, rain, and penny-sized hail are to blame for the destruction.
<br />
<br />An investigation into the complete scope of the damage is still underway but early projections are thousands of acres of crop damaged.
<br />
<br />The cost of the damage is still being calculated. Corn right now is selling for $5.86 per bushel so Olson said the cost of lost crop will easily be in the millions.
<br />
<br />&#34;Some of it will be just plain difficult to harvest, and maybe some will be impossible to harvest. We&#39;ll try to harvest all of it but I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll be able to,&#34; Wilson said.
<br />
<br />Farmers could feel the loss of this crop, financially, for two-to-five years.

									70,000 animals that should have gone to slaughter are stranded on UK farms amid staff shortages
<br />
<br />Britain’s food and drink industry is calling on the government to introduce a “Covid-19 recovery visa” to recruit overseas workers to ease disruption in the food supply chain, amid warnings from UK pig producers that healthy animals may be culled because of a labor shortage.
<br />
<br />Food and drink organisations are on average missing 13% of their workforce, according to the report, resulting in an estimated half a million vacancies across the sector.
<br />
<br />The excess number of pigs on UK farms is growing by 15,000 each week, according to the NPA,with about a quarter fewer leaving for slaughter than would be expected in normal times.
<br />
<br />Animals ready for slaughter but stuck on farms require feeding and housing, causing financial difficulties for farmers. These large pigs are growing by about a kilogram a day, the NPA says, with many becoming too large for the slaughterhouses to handle.
<br />
<br />“For the second time in under a year the pig sector is facing some really tough choices, which we shouldn’t have to be taking, as demand for British pork is still strong,” said Zoe Davies, the chief executive of the NPA.

									The “ReBlend” reclaims veg/fruit food scraps that otherwise would have been wasted into a smoothie.  It is part of the #Upcycled food movement that Whole Foods has dubbed a “major trend for 2021.”
<br />
<br />Fine.  But be aware, though, that this UPCYCLED idea is also being used as a stepping stone to the bioengineered proteins-from-plastic, food-from-trash in genera, and even food-from-human waste.
<br />
<br />Just as “fake meat” somehow includes everything from organic black bean burgers, to GMO soy + fake heme -laden Impossible Burgers, to lab-grown cell cultured meat (remember the sales pitch? “We combine de-extincted DNA from multiple species to find new meats with the best mouthfeel…”)
<br />
<br />These “trends” are carefully engineered to usher in the new reality of a wholly synthetic food system.

											<p>If you're a smoothie lover who likes to experiment, you know that making a morning blend can get pretty messy. The struggle was real for Kathryn Bernell when she was in grad school, trying to balance her busy workload with trying to, you know, feed herself. "I would make smoothies each morning. But anytime I made anything with whole fruits and veggies, my kitchen would end up a full-blown war zone," she says. "Eventually, I grew tired of all the prep—and cleaning—that went into making my favorite blends."</p>

									I mentioned Tyson requiring the vaccine of its employees, and that this would extend arbitrarily to throttle labor/control the food supply.
<br />
<br />Here you can see it happening at a small (9 people) producer, Nolechek’s Meats. USDA is revoking their mark of inspection due to not wearing facemasks in their own private facility.  The full letter is from their facebook page:
<br />
<br />___
<br />As of Thursday, 08.26.21, Nolechek’s Meats, Inc. will no longer be able to produce product with the mark of inspection. This immediately affects our wholesale customers and to the effect it will have on our business as a whole has yet to be determined.
<br />
<br />It is hard to put into words what the following means to all of us at Nolechek’s Meats. It is gut wrenching, to say the least, that it has come to the Federal government threatening private businesses through coercion. Coercion does not equal choice. This post is long, but it is vital that the public understand what it takes to be a USDA inspected facility in this country. And to understand how quickly our livelihood has been threatened.
<br />
<br />This is very real and our only hope is that someone will hear and care enough to stand up for us. All we have received from inspection personnel is that they are just doing their jobs. Well, who will pay for their salaries when there are no more plants to inspect? What will their pension or retirement matter when there is nothing left of this country? They all say they understand, but those are just words.
<br />
<br />First, the background on USDA inspection in meat plants or slaughterhouses. For a product to bear the mark of federal inspection it must be processed in a facility that is USDA inspected.
<br />
<br />To be awarded a Federal Grant of Inspection, the USDA requires a validated and verified HACCP program that covers all processes, along with supporting programs (sanitation, recall policy, listeria sampling, etc.). We obtained our full grant of inspection in July 2017 and are considered a very small processor with 9 team members….
<br />
<br />On August 4th, USDA inspected facilities received FSIS notice 30-21 regarding ‘Measures to Protect FSIS Inspection Program Personnel (IPP) from COVID-19 Infection. The United States Federal Government is now using the USDA to further their agenda to control all aspects of people’s lives in this country by coercing private businesses to wear masks by threatening to pull our Federal Grant of Inspection.
<br />
<br />It was communicated to the powers that be that we told our inspector in charge, ‘no thank you’ to us wearing masks in our facility. There was no plan in place for non-compliance if we refused to wear masks in the presence of our inspector.
<br />
<br />On August 20th a follow-up directive was published (FSIS Notice 34-21) regarding how the inspection personnel are to handle an establishment that &#39;does not follow CDC guidance and ensure that employees and contractors consistently wear masks to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission when FSIS personnel are present. As of August 25, 2021, FSIS will not provide inspection service to the establishment unless it meets this requirement to protect IPP at their establishments.&#39;

									In other words, we won&#39;t be able to produce our product with the mark of inspection after Tuesday, August 24th. Which will affect our ability to wholesale to customers, which makes up a significant portion of our business. This then affects the businesses we wholesale to because they won&#39;t have our products to use and/or sell. Nolechek’s Meats has never had a serious food safety concern or received a corrective action that has threatened the status of our Federal Grant of Inspection. We passed our Food Safety Audit in 2017 and have always gone above and beyond to communicate with our inspection personnel any questions or concerns we had.
<br />
<br />They are telling processors in our area that after today (Wednesday, 08.25.21) if they produce product with the mark of inspection, it will be considered adulterated, and a recall will take place. Even though there is no evidence of food safety violations. A plant must do something very egregious to lose their Federal Grant of Inspection. It is a process that entails numerous verbal and written non-compliance notifications and corrective actions, that must be substantiated with reference to the Code of Federal Regulations or any USDA regulation. As of today, they can suspend it with a written letter based on a directive.
<br />
<br />The federal government is infringing on our ability to run our business through coercion. Our livelihood that has spanned four generations and almost 70 years.
<br />
<br />Now is the time to stand strong to convictions. Actions speak louder than words. Speak up. Share this post. There has to be someone who can put an end to this tyrannical government oversight.

									Holy Cow - Australian Beef Prices Hit Record High As Food Inflation Concerns Persist
<br />__
<br />
<br />After decades of low inflation and relatively cheap food prices, those days appear over as food inflation soars worldwide. The latest observation that food prices are out of control is in Australia. 
<br />
<br />Australian cattle futures are at record-highs as farm operators hold back livestock from slaughterhouses to rebuild herds after years of drought forced many cattle operators to cull herds. Supply disruptions have resulted in the benchmark Eastern Young Cattle Index soaring to A$10.082 ($7.26) a kilogram. From the 2020 low, prices have more than doubled in a year.

									To the folks asking about buying direct from Nolechek’s per above letter — I reached out for a conversation, and it sounds like they are innundated and overwhelmed by support.  So that’s good news.
<br />
<br />The broader point is that this is happening everywhere.  We can’t swarm one operation, we must re-orient around local producers — doing so obviates the need for USDA inspections, AND builds a decentralized food system, not one of central corporate control!

									More problems with wheat -- these losses finally being recognized by the biggest producers in Europe.  Watch #wheat …
<br />___
<br />
<br />German 2021 wheat crop to fall 3.6% after adverse weather
<br />
<br />Germany’s 2021 wheat crop of all types is expected to fall 3.6% on the year to 21.37 million tonnes after poor weather, according to estimates released by the agriculture ministry on Wednesday. 
<br />
<br />Crops suffered from swings in weather, with a cold spring followed by a hot, dry start to the summer and then unwelcome harvest-time rain and storms, the ministry said in preliminary forecasts for the 2021 harvest. The country’s winter rapeseed harvest will increase only 0.2% on the year to 3.52 million tonnes with crops also suffering from the poor weather, the ministry said. 
<br />
<br />Germany is the European Union’s second largest wheat producer after France and is often the bloc’s largest producer of rapeseed, Europe’s main oilseed for edible oil and biodiesel production. 
<br />
<br />France’s harvest has also suffered from rainy summer weather.
<br />
<br />Torrential rain in Germany in July, which caused flooding and loss of life, was followed by widespread rain in August. This caused repeated interruption to harvesting work causing a “nail biting period” for farmers concerned about whether they would be able to gather their crops, the ministry said.

									This &#34;risk map&#34; was created by insurance company Munich Re. 
<br />
<br />Seismic and meteorologic hazards listed below for any given area are expected to increase during a #GrandSolarMinimum. Generally, risks can be expected to be amplified, plus a long term overall cooling as growing regions move towards the equator. (This doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t be hot - remember, temperature and precipitative extremes means drought/flood, hot/cold).  
<br />

									A record-breaking 44 container ships are stuck off the coast of California
<br />
<br />* Forty-four container ships are stuck outside California ports, worsening shipping delays and costs.
<br />* This tops the previous pandemic record, set in February, of 40 ships.
<br />* The ports account for about one-third of US imports, serving as a main source of trade with China.
<br />
<br />Forty-four freight ships are stuck awaiting entry into California&#39;s two largest ports, the highest number recorded since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Marine Exchange of Southern California reported on Saturday.
<br />
<br />The queue is a result of the labor shortage, COVID-19-related disruptions, and holiday-buying surges. Port of Los Angeles data indicated that the ships&#39; average wait time had increased to 7.6 days.
<br />
<br />&#34;The normal number of container ships at anchor is between zero and one,&#34; Kip Louttit, the executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California, told Insider in July.
<br />
<br />California ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach account for about one-third of US imports. These ports operate as a primary source of imports from China and have experienced heavy congestion throughout the pandemic.

									This is massive news. Remember my post yesterday citing Arlan about China REQUIRING U.S. soybeans. Now we read US export ability to China has been decimated !!
<br />
<br />A grain elevator damaged by Ida in Reserve, Louisiana is responsible for nearly 9% of America’s bulk seaborne exports of corn, soybeans and wheat so far in 2021, according to Bloomberg’s analysis of U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
<br />
<br />USDA shipments show a total of 6.45 million tons of agricultural product loaded at the Cargill terminal, with 5.3 million tons of corn topping the list. The primary recipient of crops through the elevator this year has been China, receiving 47% of its output including 2.5 million tons of corn and 485,000 tons of soybeans.

									More here on impaired grain exports - Bunge and ADM also assessing damage:
<br />
<br />The storm has disrupted grain and soybean shipments from the Gulf Coast, which accounts for about 60% of U.S. exports, at a time when global supplies are tight and demand is strong from China.
<br />
<br />Images of the damaged Cargill terminal, with a twisted and partially collapsed grain conveyor system, circulated on Twitter and were shared among grain traders and barge shippers.
<br />
<br />&#34;This area in SE Louisiana is still facing significant personal safety concerns and power outages, so we are just able to start assessing the storm’s impact on the river system. We don’t currently have a timeframe for resuming operations,&#34; Cargill said in a statement.

											<p>Hurricane Ida damaged a grain export elevator owned by global grain trader Cargill Inc, and rival shipper CHS Inc warned on Monday its grain facility may lack power for weeks after the storm tore though the busiest U.S. grains port. Cargill said its Reserve, Louisiana, terminal, one of two the company operates along the Mississippi River near the Gulf of Mexico, "sustained significant damage" when the storm roared ashore.</p>

<br />Direct Hit to Key Export Elevators, 22 Barges on the Loose: Logistical Nightmare Unfolds from Hurricane Ida
<br />
<br />Right at harvest time.
<br />
<br />Hurricane Ida&#39;s destructive winds are wreaking havoc on a vital export shipping vein, as grain elevators and barge traffics continue to be tangled from the impacts of the hurricane this week. 
<br />
<br />Monday, reports surfaced that Hurricane Ida damaged a Louisiana grain export elevator owned by Cargill Inc. It was said to have &#34;sustained significant damage.&#34; Ken Erickson, senior vice president of agribusiness with IHS market, focuses on transportation and infrastructure. He says as the destruction continues to surface, it&#39;s apparent that the U.S. export program could run into some serious delays as the area works to recovery from the impacts of Hurricane Ida. 
<br />
<br />&#34;We&#39;ve got a couple of them that are going to be down for a while, especially with Cargill having just lost some of its elevation to the ships, they&#39;ve got capability to load two ships there,&#34; says Erikson on AgriTalk. &#34;There are others that are going to be without power for awhile, and power is the big story down there with two to four weeks, if not longer, of no power just across the entire region.&#34;
