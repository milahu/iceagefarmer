Bernese farmer‚Äôs 20 cows provide electricity and heat for several houses -- via biogas
<br />
<br />Niklaus Hari converts manure and urine from his 20 cows into energy via a small biogas plant, providing electricity AND HEAT for several houses and a development.  ‚ÄúThe main thing,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúis we need the cows for their [manure].‚Äù
<br />
<br />This is ANOTHER reason the WEF is so eager to reach the ‚ÄúPost Animal Economy‚Äù ‚Äî only takes a small number of livestock to provide meat, dairy, and manure for fertilizer and energy.  
<br />
<br />To take control over FOOD, FERTILIZER, and ENERGY, they must eliminate animals from homesteads.

French refinery strikes takes half of the nation‚Äôs refining capacity offline - forcing France‚Äôs largest sugar maker, Tereos, to curtail production
<br />
<br />Diesel and petrol stations in France are running out of fuel, according to an industry union, as a refining strike takes its toll. The strike, which among others, took Total‚Äôs 240,000 bpd Gonfreville refinery offline as well as a couple of Exxon‚Äôs, was expected to conclude on Thursday‚Ä¶but Friday, reports came in that strikes were disrupting Total‚Äôs oil products refining and delivery for a fourth day ‚Äî 60% of the nation‚Äôs total refining capacity.
<br />
<br />‚ÄúThere is no need to rush to the station (for gas),‚Äù TotalEnergies said on Friday. Despite those affirmations, France‚Äôs largest sugar maker, Tereos, said it had to curtail production somewhat at some of its factories after Total advised it that it would not be able to supply it with any more diesel until the end of the week.
<br />
<br />France was already battling a shortage of refined products, with Russia‚Äôs exports to Europe ‚Äúfalling‚Äù in recent months.

PETA Calls for Strike on Sex with Meat-Eating Men

<br />Recall the UN &amp; EAT/Lancet&#39;s &#34;Planetary Health Diet&#34; are all about demonizing meat-eating to make it &#34;socially taboo like smoking.&#34;

Netherlands: greenhouses and growers increasingly shutting down operations due to energy prices.  Those greenhouses accounted for nearly 40% of veg in Europe...
<br />
<br />Video opens with a business owner heating her store with candles/terracotta:  &#34;I lost my customers with COVID, and now inflation is so high people don&#39;t have money to buy children&#39;s clothes.&#34;
<br />
<br />The elderly person with candle/terracotta heater is, to me, iconic of the strangulation that is gripping Europe in this engineered energy crisis.

Vegetable/legume company HAK STOPS production for 6 weeks starting 2023. Energy prices make it infeasible to produce, says the market leader best known for the glass jars of applesauce, peas and brown beans.
<br />
<br />&#34;It is not only the high price, but also the uncertainty, says director Timo Hoogeboom. &#34;Today it is two euros for a cubic meter of gas, it used to be three euros. We don&#39;t know what it will be in January or February. So to be on the safe side, we will remain closed.&#34;
<br />
<br />If it is no longer possible to pass on the higher energy prices to consumers, the availability of products may ultimately also be compromised. &#34;If companies have to sell below cost for months, things go wrong.&#34; He does not expect any empty shelves for HAK for the time being. &#34;But I don&#39;t rule it out for the chain, especially in January, February and March.&#34; A temporary energy ceiling for companies could help, the HAK director thinks.
<br />
<br />&#34;Companies will first look at how they can absorb the costs themselves, but if that is no longer possible, they will have to scale down,&#34; confirms food economist Morren. &#34;I expect this to happen more widely.&#34;

Brazilian soybean processors have halted operations as crushing margins turned negative.
<br />
<br />Abiove, a trade group representing global oilseed crushers in Brazil, confirmed the move, telling Reuters some of its members advanced scheduled maintenance stoppages that traditionally happen at the end of the year as soyoil prices dropped while soybean prices remained high, hurting margins.

Dolphins, skunks, foxes now apparently have #BirdFlu as well ‚Äî Remember : the agenda is ‚Äúanimals are dirty and dangerous and we must separate MAN from NATURE into the SmartCities!‚Äù
<br />
<br />In Maine, an elevated number of gray and harbor seal deaths have been attributed to the disease, while in Florida, officials believe a bottle-nosed dolphin succumbed to the virus. It&#39;s also been detected in skunks and foxes.
<br />
<br />After proliferating globally, a historic wave of avian flu has entered Southern California, where it is worrying farmers and bird lovers and could add to complications with supply chains and food prices.
<br />
<br />In late August, one New Jersey park had to close its trails to hikers. There were too many dead vultures on the ground.

Unbelievable - Terrible timing to not be able to export grains/oilseeds:
<br />
<br />U.S. barge backlog swells on parched Mississippi River
<br />
<br />Commercial barge traffic on southern stretches of the Mississippi River was at a standstill on Tuesday as low water levels halted shipments of grain, fertilizer and other commodities on the critical waterway, shipping sources said.
<br />
<br />The supply chain snarl comes just as harvesting of corn and soybeans, the largest U.S. cash crops, is ramping up and as tight global supplies and strong demand for food and fuel have sent inflation soaring.
<br />
<br />Around 100 tow boats hauling some 1,600 barges were lined up for miles waiting to pass through one trouble spot near Lake Providence, Louisiana, that has been largely closed since late last week, shipping sources said.
<br />
<br />At least two other sections of the lower Mississippi have also been closed at times, disrupting the flow of grain to U.S. Gulf Coast export terminals, where some 60% of U.S. corn, soybean and wheat exports exit the country, they said.
<br />
<br />Shippers have been loading less cargo per barge so vessels sit higher on the water, and towing companies have reduced the number of barges per tow by nearly 40% as the low water conditions narrowed the navigable channel.

Force majeure declarations have begun due to barges stopped in Mississippi due to low water levels
<br />
<br />This affects not just the grains harvest, but fertilizer applications.
<br />
<br />A logjam of ships, tugboats and barges due to low water levels on the Mississippi River is threatening to grind trade of grains, fertilizer and other goods to a halt, Bloomberg reports. Ingram Barge Company, the largest U.S. barge operator, declared force majeure in a letter to customers due to ‚Äúnear-historic‚Äù low water conditions on the Mississippi River. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Coast Guard said there was a queue of 122 vessels at Stack Island and 15 vessels at Memphis. Due to increased groundings, the number of vessels in tow is being restricted.

More food infrastructure burning - Canadian bridge causes grains transport issues:
<br />
<br />‚ÄúAn entire economy is relying on these little ribbons of steel through Canada&#39;
<br />
<br />A bridge burned down on the Canadian National Railway Co. line, about 95 kilometres to the south, severing the only rail link in or out of Grande Prairie and causing backlogs for the grain shippers who depend on that track to get their product to port.
<br />
<br />CN said the severed line only moves a fraction of the total grain coming off fields in Western Canada. But for grain farmers and exporters, the bridge fire was another example of the fragility of the national supply lines that connect one of the world‚Äôs most important bread baskets with seaports and global markets.

<br />
<br />Gabe Brown of Browns Ranch ‚Äî a pioneer of the soil-health movement and regenerative practices ‚Äî joins Christian to discuss regenerative practices and soil health as the bottom line solutions to the myriad problems we face. We discuss the Covid19 pandemic and what we can learn from it, how healthy living soil helped Brown‚Äôs Ranch weather the difficult, cold and wet 2019 season in North Dakota ‚Äî and can do the same for you! Producers from homesteaders/gardeners to larger farmer ranchers can start improving their operations immediately without huge capital investment. Gabe also describes how they have actually been getting a boost in sales due to their direct-to-market approach. And of course we describe the 6 rules for building amazing soil and growing lots of food!

The BASF keystone:  as goes the gas, so goes BASF, so goes Germany, so goes Europe . . . 
<br />
<br />&#34;Everything is connected at the German chemical firm BASF‚Äôs Ludwigshafen site, a 10 sq km industrial complex so large that byproducts from making ammonia, for example, are funnelled through a 1,771-mile pipe network to produce fertiliser, disinfectant, diesel exhaust fluid, or CO2 for fizzy drinks.
<br />
<br />The plant is a giant integrated process ‚Äî and it cannot run without a supply of natural gas.
<br />
<br />‚ÄúOnce we can receive &lt; 50% of our maximum requirements, we would need to wind down the entire site,‚Äù says a  spokesperson. 
<br />
<br />The consequences of a BASF shutdown would be far-reaching, not just in Germany but the entire continent. 
<br />
<br />BASF-produced chemicals are used to make anything from toothpaste to vitamins, [and animal feed]. It&#39;s a top manufacturer of painkillers, and its largest customer industry is the automobile industry [‚Äî and AdBlue, which is required to run diesel engines, and keep trucking running ... ].

Power down? Try salt curing for a low-electricity alternative
<br />
<br />Power cuts, rationing or sky-high energy prices? Who knows what this season will hold. Cooking without power may sound apocalyptic, but there are plenty of ways to get creative in the kitchen, all while keeping electricity use to a minimum.
<br />
<br />One alternative is to cure food with salt.
<br />
<br />From a chemical point of view, salt also has hygroscopic properties. When in contact with moist food, salt has the ability to absorb the water contained in the food. And it is this phenomenon that is interesting to note when it comes to cutting power use.

Good piece : BIG VEGANISM is cover for corporate takeover of food production! 
<br />
<br />‚ÄúMultinationals love the phrase ‚Äúplant-based‚Äù because it is a euphemism for the messianic, cultish, modish cause they have adopted: veganism.‚Äù
<br />
<br />Some of the alt-protein research in Food Valley is directed towards consuming insects (‚Äúentomophagy‚Äù); some is more focused on algae, fungi ‚Äî¬†or mycobacterial this, that and the other. But the big research bucks are flowing one way only, and that is to plant-based alternatives to meat.

‚ÄúMany agrifood sectors are now  controlled by just four to six dominant firms, enabling these companies to wield enormous influence over markets, agricultural research and policy-development, which undermines food sovereignty.
<br />
<br />2020 was a horrific year for food security and health ‚Äì but a bonanza for Big Food and Big Ag. Food Barons made the most of the converging crises in order to tighten their grip on every link in the Industrial Food Chain. In doing so, they undermine the rights of peasants, smallholders, fishers and pastoralists to produce food for their own communities and many others. 
<br />
<br />The Food Barrons are accelerating digitalization of food and agriculture across the chain in order to hold on to, naturalize and expand their power, despite their many failings.

GPS signal jamming causes flights to be rerouted around DFW airport (Dallas, TX):

<br />Is this the interference from 5G or someone testing the waters for active jamming? A lot of logistics AND farm equipment depends on GPS:

Empty Shelves as Inflation Leaves Products Unprofitable
<br />
<br />‚ÄúNot only Mars [who worked hand in hand with Rockefeller Foundation on &#34;Reset the Table‚Äù], but also Coca Cola [WEF partner] or Procter &amp; Gamble [WEF Partner]  are currently trying to ride the wave of inflation with excessive price demands in order to increase their returns,‚Äù a spokesman for the Edaka chain of supermarkets claimed.
<br />
<br />The official went on to claim that a number of major companies have now halted deliveries to the chain, something that they alleged is being used to put pressure on supermarkets.
<br />
<br />[IceAgeFarmer: the Rockefeller/WEF partners are squeezing you as hard as they can.]
<br />
<br />‚Äî‚Äî
<br />
<br />Products ranging from Kellogg‚Äôs cornflakes to Coca Cola have disappeared from supermarkets throughout Germany, with many shops being left with empty shelves as products become simply unprofitable to sell due to differentials in inflation.
<br />
<br />It comes as overall inflation hit 10% in the country in September, with EU-wide inflation for the month falling just short of 11% as a result of the ongoing #EnergyCrisis, which has in turn hiked the cost of food and other essential goods.
<br />
<br />Retailers in the country however have strongly resisted this, with one supermarket chain in the country going so far as to accuse major companies of ‚Äúprice gouging‚Äù and ‚Äúusury‚Äù.
<br />
<br />‚ÄúThe situation in the industry is critical to catastrophic,‚Äù Federal Association of the Food Industry general manager Christoph Minhoff remarked regarding the feud, which has seen some individual rows even reportedly ending up in court as companies are unable to come to a compromise.
<br />
<br />As a result of these ongoing hostilities between supermarkets and producers, a wide variety of well-known brands have disappeared from supermarkets throughout Germany, leaving many shops with empty shelves.
<br />
<br />The likes of Coca Cola, Pepsi, Snickers, Kellogg‚Äôs Cornflakes, Milka Chocolate, Ritter Sport chocolate, Wrigley‚Äôs chewing gum, along with many other products ranging from mayonnaise to pet food have all been affected, though availability reportedly varies between supermarket chains.

U.S. winter wheat farmers plant into dust as Plains drought persists
<br />
<br />&#34;It&#39;s sort of a grim situation,&#34; said Kent Winter, who farms in Andale, Kansas, outside Wichita. He said he normally seeds by mid-October but has yet to plant any.
<br />
<br />[ IceAgeFarmer note:  I have never before seen #wheat trending on twitter ‚Ä¶ ]
<br />
<br />The 2023 U.S. hard red winter wheat crop is already being hobbled by drought in the heart of the southern Plains, wheat experts said.
<br />
<br />Planting plans may be scaled back in the U.S. breadbasket despite historically high prices for this time of year, reflecting rising global demand and thin world wheat supplies projected to end the 2022/23 marketing year at a six-year low. The tight supplies have been exacerbated as the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted grain exports from the Black Sea region.
<br />
<br />The drought threatens Kansas, the top winter wheat growing state, and Oklahoma in two ways: discouraging farmers who have not yet planted from trying, while threatening crops already in the ground from developing properly.

Persistent drought conditions and high winds are creating dangerous harvest conditions for Missouri farmers.
<br />
<br />Missouri farmer Robert Schmidt says there were several combine fires across the state over the weekend, including one near his farm. ‚ÄúThe farmer was able to get out some of the crops from the 800 acres that burned. The fire put itself out with the help of the fire department containing it to a wetland area.‚Äù

<br />‚ÄúThe best thing we can get is many hours of steady rainfall to soak into the soil profile.‚Äù According to the latest U.S. Drought Monitor, all of Missouri is categorized as abnormally dry to exceptional drought, with 14 percent in extreme to exceptional drought.

US diesel shortage: we‚Äôve been hearing this for months but now suppliers are actually putting out alerts:
<br />
<br />‚Äî
<br />US diesel shortages are spreading along the East Coast amid a ban on imports from Russia, raising fears of further surges in prices for the fuel as consumers brace for the winter heating season.
<br />
<br />Mansfield Energy, one of the nation‚Äôs major fuel distributors, instituted emergency measures on Tuesday and warned its customers that carriers were being forced to visit multiple terminals in some cases to find supplies, delaying deliveries.
<br />
<br />‚ÄúIn many areas, actual fuel prices are currently 30-80 cents higher than the posted market average because supply is tight,‚Äù said Mansfield.
<br />
<br />With shortages spreading from the Northeast to the Southeast, the company advised customers to give 72-hour notice for their orders to avoid having to pay above-market prices:

With only ~20 days of US supply remaining, Diesel, along with heating oil, aviation fuel and kerosene, headed towards record prices.
<br />
<br />‚ÄúThe economy runs on diesel,‚Äù said Cinquegrana. ‚ÄúThink of everything you buy in the store, it was brought there by trains and trucks. Construction works, etc. High diesel prices could slow down economic activity. Prices are down from all-time highs in mid-June, but not enough to allay concerns.‚Äù
<br />
<br />‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a lot that can be done to prepare for very tight diesel supplies, so this is going to be a serious problem. I think the White House is monitoring it, but I don‚Äôt see a lot of levers they could pull that could really affect prices because it‚Äôs a global issue.‚Äù
<br />
<br />But you can ‚Äî and should ‚Äî get prepared personally.

Tanzania starts rationing water due to drought
<br />
<br />[You don&#39;t need water EVERY day‚Ä¶]
<br />
<br />Tanzanian authorities on Thursday began rationing water in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam following a drought-induced drop in water levels from its main source, the Ruvu river.
<br />
<br />The 5.5 million inhabitants of the Indian Ocean city will go without piped water for 24 hours on alternating days, the Dar es Salaam Water and Sanitation Authority (DAWASA) said.
<br />
<br />&#34;The timetable will be updated every week according to how the change of weather increases or decreases the water levels,&#34; it said.

They REALLY ARE building this SmartCity in the desert - a linear structure 170km long, 500m tall, with mirrored facade, to hold 9 million people.
<br />
<br />Hopefully you also REALLY ARE building your own homestead (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 2030, I own a farm and am happy!‚Äù) and community.

Fear of global food shortage looms as Russia steps back from Ukraine grain deal
<br />
<br />U.S. President Joe Biden warned that global¬†hunger could increase because of Russia‚Äôs suspension of a U.N.-brokered deal to allow safe passage for ships carrying Ukrainian grain.
<br />
<br />‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really outrageous,‚Äù said Biden speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no merit to what they‚Äôre doing. The UN negotiated that deal and that should be the end of it.‚Äù
<br />Biden spoke hours after Russia announced it would immediately halt participation in the agreement, alleging ghat Ukraine staged a drone attack Saturday against Russia‚Äôs Black Sea Fleet ships off the coast of occupied Crimea. Ukraine has denied the attack.
