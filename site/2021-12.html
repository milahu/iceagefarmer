<br />
<br />Every central bank in the world is rushing to launch a digital currency...but why? And who is pulling the strings behind the scenes?  As it turns out, we don&#39;t need a &#39;social credit score&#39; when money itself is used to control our behavior. Christian breaks down the reality behind this global, synchronous push for digital currencies and the elimination of cash in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

World food prices climb in November, stay at 10-year peak -FAO
<br />
<br />ROME (Reuters) - Agricultural commodity prices have risen steeply in the past year, driven by harvest setbacks and strong demand.
<br />
<br />World food prices rose for a fourth straight month in November to remain at 10-year highs, led by strong demand for wheat and dairy products, the U.N. food agency said on Thursday.
<br />
<br />The Food and Agriculture Organization&#39;s (FAO) food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 134.4 points last month compared with a revised 132.8 for October.
<br />
<br />The FAO&#39;s cereal price index rose by 3.1% in November from the previous month and was 23.2% higher than its year-ago level, with wheat prices hitting their highest level since May 2011.
<br />
<br />The dairy price index posted the largest monthly rise, up 3.4% from the previous month. &#34;Strong global import demand persisted for butter and milk powders as buyers sought to secure spot supplies in anticipating of tightening markets,&#34; FAO said.

After my last report, people are asking what domain registrar I use.  I got off GoDaddy a while ago and moved to Epik Domains, which is also what bitchute is using.  Here is my link to Epik:

<br />
<br />Note that I don’t consider this a silver bullet.  I am still looking at IPFS and other technologies.  And even then, I believe they own the digital space, and we need to be spreading the word offline!  Flyers, t-shirts, good old conversations, etc.! 🙂

Australia Sees Record Wheat Harvest But Warns Rains Hurt Quality
<br />
<br />Bigger harvest, but poorer quality, in some cases not salable:
<br />_
<br />
<br />Australia, one of the world’s biggest wheat growers, boosted its official production forecast by more than 5% to a record, but warned that heavy rains and floods had damaged the crop in the east of the country.
<br />
<br />Global wheat prices are near the highest in nine years and importers have been looking to Australia for extra supplies of the grain used in everything from bread and cakes, to pastries and bagels. Torrential downpours at the wrong time in New South Wales and Queensland hurt the crop and reduced the quality.

<br />‘Our Money Has No Value’: Frustration Rises in Turkey at Lira Crisis
<br />
<br />ISTANBUL — Lines outside bread stores and gas stations; farmers defaulting on loans; impromptu street demonstrations. The signs of economic distress in Turkey are all too clear as the lira continues a dizzying slide.
<br />
<br />The currency has lost more than 45 percent of its value this year, and nearly 20 percent in the last week, continuing its downward trend on Tuesday.
<br />
<br />“Our purchasing power dropped — our money has no value anymore,” she said.
<br />
<br />Business has stalled around the country as inflation scares away domestic shoppers and causes producers to hoard goods.
<br />
<br />Shortages are emerging, including in imported medicines and medical equipment, and even at bakeries, Mr. Yesilada, the analyst, said. A loaf of bread still sells at 2.5 liras, or about 20 cents, but bakeries are complaining that their costs are closer to 4 liras a loaf, he said. “Soon they are going to shut down bakeries and then we are going to have bread riots,” he said.

You can SMELL the agenda here — animals are dirty and dangerous.  Soon CDC will recommend backyard chickens be made illegal.  Just as UK is forcing their birds inside, and killing off massive numbers of chickens because “bird flu.”  
<br />
<br />Germ theory has proven to be a hell of a weapon.

<br />CDC closes investigation of Salmonella outbreaks linked to backyard poultry
<br />
<br />“Backyard poultry, like chicken and ducks, can carry Salmonella germs even if they look healthy and clean,” CDC said in its report on the outbreak. “These germs can easily spread to anything in the areas where the poultry live and roam.
<br />
<br />“You can get sick from touching your backyard poultry or anything in their environment and then touching your mouth or food and swallowing Salmonella germs.”

<br />
<br />They’re Coming for your Animals — UK confirms gassing chickens
<br />
<br />Governments are moving rapidly to remove your right to raise animals completely. The UK has confirmed via FOIA the gassing of people’s backyard chickens around a poultry facility in Kent. Colorado’s PAUSE act will destroy their meat industry. And livestock registration is rolling out around the world. There is a war on Animal Agriculture. Yes, factory farms are abhorrent, and we must rapidly move to a decentralized, regenerative food system–but rather than support this, governments are pointing at disgusting CAFOs and saying, “We must END ALL ANIMAL AGRICULTURE.” They are precluding the solution, so that they take total control of food production. Christian breaks it down AND explains why we cannot allow this to happen.

“Canada is facing a food shortage that is likely to get worse. In a joint statement released in early November, 21 produce supply organizations from across the US and Canada warned that there was a “serious threat” of food shortages. Beyond reducing variety, these shortages could cause ripple effects in society. 
<br />The lack of food causes increased prices: food inflation for November was 3.8 per cent. With inflation outpacing wages, it is more difficult for people with lower incomes to access food.”
<br />
<br />Students are being told “the food shortages have reached U of T’s dining halls. Food Services has developed and implemented strategies to reduce the effects of supply issues on what shows up on students’ plates. However, many disruptions in the food supply seem to be here to stay — and their effects could worsen in the future.”

Languishing Walnuts Show How Shipping Crisis Is Hurting U.S. Farmers
<br />
<br />The shrink-wrapped boxes of fresh California walnuts stacked almost to the ceiling in Don Barton’s California packing facility should be headed to Europe for holiday baking and to Asia for New Year celebrations.
<br />
<br />Instead, newly cleaned and shelled nuts – about $10 million worth – are stuck at his processing plant near Sacramento, thousands of miles from their destinations, as the global supply chain crisis squeezes ports.

Australian farmer warns urea supply crisis could halt normal life within weeks
<br />
<br />- AdBlue needed for diesel vehicles — half of all trucks on Australian roads run on diesel (along with a quarter of all registered vehicles.)
<br />- Fertilizer for food:
<br />
<br />“&#39;Not only will we not be able to grow cattle and we will not be able to grow food and we will not be able to grow grain or anything like that, but even if we could, we can&#39;t move it, because we can&#39;t turn a wheel in a truck because we have no Adblue,&#39;
<br />
<br />As of February we might not have a truck on the road in Australia, we might not have a train on the tracks.
<br />
<br />&#39;So quite literally the whole country comes to a standstill as of February.&#39;

Rolling out the sewage for crops.  Disgusting.
<br />
<br />“In the UK, not only are farmers scrambling for animal compost, but many are even trying to get their hands on treated sewage sludge containing human excrement, or biosolids.
<br />
<br />__
<br />
<br />“The market for manure — from pigs, horses, cattle and even humans — has never been so hot, thanks to a global shortage of chemical fertilisers.”
<br />
<br />… and THIS is part of why they want to eliminate animal agriculture!
<br />
<br />“Just ask Andrew Whitelaw, a grains analyst at Thomas Elder Markets based in Melbourne, Australia, who runs a commercial pig farm in his spare time. Whitelaw said that he has completely sold clean of animal waste, as farmers hunt for alternatives to the more commonly used phosphate- and nitrogen-based fertilisers that are vital to boosting crop yields.
<br />
<br />“We don’t have any left,” he said. “In a normal year, you’d probably get a couple phone calls a year, not a couple of phone calls a week.”
<br />
<br />The demand for dung is playing out globally. In Iowa, manure is selling for $40-$70 per tonne, up about $10 from a year ago and the highest levels since 2012, according to Daniel Anderson, assistant professor at Iowa State University and a specialist on manure. 
<br />
<br />In the UK, not only are farmers scrambling for animal compost, but many are even trying to get their hands on treated sewage sludge containing human excrement, or biosolids.

Thousands of truckers prepared to walk due to vaccine mandates, warn Canadian trucking groups
<br />
<br />Canadian trucking industry groups are warning the Canadian government that supply chain challenges will get worse unless there are changes to upcoming COVID-19 vaccination mandates.
<br />
<br />The Canadian Trucking Alliance (CTA) says it estimates that up to 22 thousand Canadian drivers will decide to leave the Canada-U.S. market when the Canadian government’s planned cross-border vaccination mandate takes effect on January 15, 2022.
<br />
<br />Based on a recent survey of its members, the CTA says many trucking companies are preparing to lose 10 to 20 per cent of their drivers, and potentially more than 20 per cent in regions of the country with lower vaccination rates.
<br />
<br />“There are also pockets of fleets throughout Canada with vaccine rates well below the 80 per cent vaccination rate floor, CTA members have reported. Vaccination rates below 80 per cent would lead to significant service disruptions…,” says the CTA, in a Dec. 8 update.

DELIBERATE throttling of #SupplyChain: 
<br />
<br />Mississauga, Ont., truck driver Nawaz Khan said he makes two to three trips across the U.S. border each week, transporting building supplies.
<br />
<br />However, Khan’s FAST card, which clears him for customs when crossing, recently expired. This required him to drive to the U.S. in his personal vehicle to get it renewed. He was there for less than 45 minutes.  “I did the interview, I came back to the Canadian side,” Khan said.  When he returned, border agents told Khan he had to quarantine for two weeks, despite being fully vaccinated.
<br />
<br />“I was shocked,” he said.   “I have to park my rig for almost a month,” he said. “I don’t believe I have done anything wrong.”
<br />
<br />With vaccinated essential workers being forced into quarantine, Shields said this could lead to supply chain issues ahead of the holidays.

‘Perfect storm’ of issues behind latest price hike causing pain at the supermarket checkout
<br />It’s an essential item that most Aussies consume daily – and it just got a whole lot more expensive, with even more pain on the way.
<br />
<br />“Dairy is becoming more expensive to make, with farmers slugged by skyrocketing prices when it comes to things like grain and fertiliser.
<br />
<br />We also have fewer cows in Australia in the wake of the drought of 2018-19, which saw many farmers cull their livestock to get through that tough period.

China throws yet another wrench on the gears of food supply chain:
<br />____
<br />
<br />New China import rules bring headaches for food and beverage makers
<br />
<br />China&#39;s customs authority published new food safety rules in April stipulating all food manufacturing, processing and storage facilities abroad need to be registered by year-end for their goods to access the Chinese market.
<br />
<br />But detailed procedures explaining how to get the required registration codes were only issued in October, while a website for companies allowed to self-register went online last month.
<br />
<br />&#34;We&#39;re heading for major disruptions after Jan. 1,&#34; said a Beijing-based diplomat from a European country who is assisting food producers with the new measures.

DARPA seeks ‘top chef’ for 3D printed food
<br />
<br />The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is inviting small-business innovators to submit ideas for turning cellular biomass created through its ReSource program into safe, visually appealing, edible and palatable food that can support the military and civilians when traditional food is unavailable.
<br />
<br />DARPA’s ReSource program aims to engineer versatile, durable systems that use local feedstock and mixed waste to rapidly produce a wide range of on-demand products, ranging from potable water and “edible macronutrient” to  lubricants, adhesives and tactical fibers to support expeditionary units and humanitarian relief operations.
<br />
<br />Announced Nov. 23, the Innovative Nutritional Formulations program aims to turn edible biomass into palatable food rations at scale under austere conditions for disaster relief, as a backup food supply for submarines and aircraft carriers and to supplement vulnerable supply lines. Besides delivering sufficient calories, vitamins and nutrition for those in inaccessible locations, the program aims to reduce the military infrastructure’s carbon footprint, maximize on-site resources and develop ways to generate materials in the field.
<br />
<br />Proposers can develop the cellular biomass into liquid, powder, paste or edible ink -- so long as it is  compatible “with 3D printing formats and other, low footprint, minimal logistical technologies,” DARPA said. Other considerations include sterilization or pasteurization requirements, the on-site sourcing of materials and compatibility with design of the overall system.

Four major threats almost guaranteeing another challenging year for shippers
<br />
<br />The fractious relationship between ocean carriers and their freight forwarder is seen as one of four key disrupters to the supply chain next year, by maritime consultant Drewry.
<br />
<br />“We are starting to see that some ocean carriers are withdrawing from NVOCC relationships and others making it difficult for NVOs to offer carrier-like fixed-contract rates to shippers under preferential ‘named account’ terms agreed in advance with ocean carriers,” it said.
<br />
<br />Several forwarding contacts have told The Loadstar they have been unable to secure rate agreements from the lines for January on the Asia-North Europe and transatlantic routes.
<br />
<br />“Our account manager seems to have gone to ground – 18 months ago we couldn’t get rid of him, now he’s constantly unavailable and doesn’t reply to our e-mails,” said a director of one UK-based NVOCC.
<br />
<br />Another forwarder said all he got back from his account manager was “excuses” for not quoting January rates, and that the stock answer from carriers was: “Let’s wait until after CNY.”
<br />
<br />As a consequence, small, and even some mid-sized, forwarders and NVOCCs are unable to offer any guidance on next year’s freight charges to their shipper customers.
<br />
<br />The fear from this situation is that it will force many smaller shippers to, at best, defer their orders or, in some cases, abandon their product orderbooks altogether, given the uncertainty in the market and the risk that lower-value imports will become unsustainable.

Law set to go into effect that could cause egg shortages in Massachusetts - 90% eggs to become unavailable
<br />
<br />Anyone in Massachusetts who still enjoys bacon and eggs for breakfast may be forced to opt for a healthier meal as of the new year. [IAF: subtext: animal source foods aren&#39;t healthy?  relentless, untruthful propaganda!] That&#39;s unless state lawmakers reach a last-minute deal to prevent new restrictions that could prohibit the sale of most eggs and pork products in the state.
<br />
<br />A ballot question overwhelmingly approved by Massachusetts voters in 2016 tied humane treatment of chickens and hogs to the sale of eggs and pork products, beginning in 2022. Few farms meet those standards.
<br />
<br />The egg industry predicts chaos, as 90% of available eggs in Massachusetts may become unavailable come January 1 if the law is not amended before then.
<br />
<br />&#34;I don&#39;t want Massachusetts families to have to pay upwards of $5 per dozen of eggs come Jan. 1,&#34; said State Sen. Becca Rausch (D-Needham), one of six members of a committee appointed to negotiate a compromise. &#34;That will be unaffordable to droves of Bay Staters.&#34;
<br />
<br />Even if a last-minute deal is reached, changing the law while lawmakers are meeting only in informal sessions would require no objections from any member of either body.

<br />The initial cells are obtained through “a variety of methods,” the site says, including “biopsies from living animals, eggs, fishing, and recently slaughtered animals who were already a part of the food system.”
<br />
<br />“We feed the cell a range of nutrients (amino acids, sugars, trace minerals, and vitamins) normally found in food and compositionally similar to what develops organically in animal body, just in a different format,

<br />“We&#39;re committed to completely detaching our production process from animal slaughter,” the company says. “Our aim is to bring animal component-free products to market as soon as we can.”

USDA plows $100mm from “American Rescue Plan,” part into fake foods, lab-grown meat — which will put American farmers out of business.  
<br />
<br />WASHINGTON – The US Department of Agriculture and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack recently announced $100 million in funds under the new Food Supply Chain Guaranteed Loan Program that would uphold nearly $1 billion in loan guarantees. 
<br />
<br />The agency said the loan guarantees would back private investment in processing and food system infrastructure that will strengthen the food supply chain. The money was made available through the American Rescue Plan.
<br />
<br />“The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities and created extreme disruptions in America’s food supply chain,” Vilsack said. “The reduction in meat processing capacity is just one example of the supply chain bottlenecks that affect small and midsize farmers.”

Russia considering wheat export quota of 9 million tons
<br />
<br />Russia, one of the world’s biggest wheat exporters, has been taking steps to slow sales abroad to curb domestic food inflation. It’s also introduced a floating tax on grain exports, though the measures have had limited effects on total seasonal volumes.
<br />
<br />However, the decision will be closely watched in the global wheat market, which is facing increasingly tight supplies after crops around the world were hit by droughts, frost and heavy rain.
<br />
<br />Benchmark prices in Chicago reached a nine-year high last month.

<br />Kremlin reveals new independent Russian-Chinese financial systems
<br />
<br />Russia and China will develop shared financial structures to enable them to deepen economic ties in a way that foreign states will be unable to influence, the Kremlin has announced following talks between the countries’ leaders.
<br />
<br />The move appears to be a response to a series of warnings that Western nations could push to disconnect Russia from the Brussels-based SWIFT financial system as a form of sanctions.
<br />
<br />The payment platform underpins the vast majority of international transactions. During the talks on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping called for increasing the share of national currencies in mutual settlements and expanding cooperation to provide Russian and Chinese investors with access to stock markets, said Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy advisor.

<br />Russian Central Bank Seeks Ban on Crypto Investment: Report
<br />
<br />The central bank is in discussions with market players regarding a possible ban. If approved by lawmakers, the ban would only apply to new purchases of crypto assets not to past purchases, the report added.
<br />
<br />Russia has been vocal in its stance against against cryptocurrencies, stating that the asset can be used for money laundering or to finance terrorism.  (But use OUR e-ruble that we can control, and have NIRP!  Suckers!  Coming early 2022)

Just one more example — JBS, world’s biggest meat company — drops $100 mil for a lab-grown meat company.  Doesn’t make any sense unless you accept JBS — a WEF partner! — is replacing itself, at the behest of the WEF, positioning for the #PostAnimalEconomy:

<br />
<br />Brazilian meatpacker JBS has agreed to buy Spanish company BioTech Foods, while also creating a new research and development center in Brazil for lab meat as part of a $100 million push into the fast-growing sector.
<br />
<br />“The acquisition marks the company’s entry into the cultivated protein market,” JBS said in a filing.

<br />
<br />More than two dozen cargo vessels are stuck in Russia’s Arctic ice, waiting for ice-breakers to come to their rescue, after an inaccurate forecast from the country’s Met Office.
<br />
<br />But this year several segments of the Northern Sea Route froze up about a fortnight earlier than usual, catching many ships unawares.

<br />Giant Kites That Drag Cargo Ships Across Oceans Go on Trial

<br />Add ships being dragged along by giant kites to the list of things the industry is exploring in its quest to decarbonize.
<br />
<br />At the start of next year, the Ville de Bordeaux, a 154-meter-long ship that moves aircraft components for Airbus SE, will unfurl a 500 square meter kite on journeys across the Atlantic Ocean. It will undergo six months of trials and tests before full deployment.
<br />
<br />Shipping carries more than 80% of all goods traded globally but also accounts for almost 3% of man-made carbon dioxide emissions.

What is a zero-carbon future? What does it look like? To imagine, turn off your heater. No airports. No shipping. No animals. Perfect surveillance state. In this Ice Age Farmer special report, Christian breaks The “Absolute Zero” plan and how governments are actively taking drastic steps every day to meet these dystopian goals for Travel, Transport, Energy, Manufacturing, Recycling, and Food. We must understand the reality underneath their flowery philanthropic language: Absolute Slavery.

<br />Could Sunflowers Solve the Cream Cheese Crisis? Spero® Says Yes. Expanding Into Food Service.
<br />
<br />“Don&#39;t panic bagel connoisseurs and professional shmear-ers, Spero sunflower cream cheese is here to save the day, and emits an estimated 99% less CO2 than dairy!
<br />
<br />On October 28, Market Realist was one of the early reporters of a nationwide cream cheese shortage. Fast forward to December, the shortage has become a full-fledged crisis, making headlines on CNN, Food &amp; Wine, NBC and more. Supply chains are unable to determine when stock will be replenished. Most affected are New York City bagel shops and grocery stores with the exception of Black Seed Bagels, an artisan bagel shop led by James Beard-nominated executive chef and head baker, Dianna Daoheung. Black Seed partners with Spero® Foods, also a woman-owned business, that makes cream cheese out of organic sunflower seeds.
<br />
<br />If the name Spero® sounds familiar, the company was recently featured on The Today Show, TED, Forbes, Fast Company, and is the 3rd Fastest Growing Plant-Based Cheese in the US (SPINS). Led by engineer-scientist Phaedra, Spero® is a plant-based dairy Company that makes dairy alternatives from seeds.

Kansas family looks to recover livelihood after wildfires kill cattle
<br />
<br />Wildfires that swept through western Kansas this week tore through his pasture, killing roughly a third of the family’s cow and calves. Koester was stuck at home Wednesday night. Though he wanted to go check on the cattle at his large pasture 50 miles away near Paradise in Russell County, Kansas, and bring them home, with the high winds, he couldn’t make the hour-long commute. When text messages from his daughters about wildfires near him began flooding in he immediately got concerned. “I got on my phone to my neighbor that lives right next to our pasture, or has the patch right next to us, and asked him what he knew about it. And he says, ‘There’s a fire coming through and it doesn’t look good,’” Koester told The Star. The wildfires, propelled by high winds from Colorado and sparked by downed power lines, swept through Russell County, leaving destroyed homes and farm land in their wake. Winds reached gusts of 100 mph, according to officials. The fires were still burning through Friday.

Chickens, tractors, grain silos destroyed by deadly U.S. tornadoes
<br />
<br />A Deere &amp; Co (DE.N) dealership and a Pilgrim&#39;s Pride Corp (PPC.O) chicken hatchery were destroyed when deadly tornadoes swept through Kentucky on Friday, while silos holding millions of bushels of corn suffered damage, the companies and the state&#39;s agriculture commissioner said on Monday.
<br />
<br />&#34;We have a 200-mile swath through Kentucky that has pulled-down grain systems, destroyed chicken hatcheries and of course blown-over barns,&#34; said Ryan Quarles, Kentucky&#39;s agriculture commissioner.
<br />
<br />The destruction in the Midwest could further raise already high chicken prices and add to supply-chain headaches  that have made it difficult for farmers to replace tractor parts.
<br />
<br />Poultry is Kentucky&#39;s top agricultural commodity, and at least a dozen chicken barns collapsed, Quarles said. The state is working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to properly kill and dispose of chickens housed in barns that were destroyed, he said.
<br />
<br />One Pilgrim&#39;s Pride chicken hatchery was a total loss, and another is expected to be offline until spring after suffering significant damage, the company said in a statement. 
<br />
<br />Pilgrim&#39;s, which is mostly owned by Brazilian meatpacker JBS SA, is evaluating damage to a local feedmill, while a production plant is expected to be fully operational on Wednesday, the statement said.
<br />
<br />The loss of the hatchery in Mayfield &#34;automatically triggers a multi-month delay in the processing and raising of chickens because the hatchery simply is not there anymore to supply the farmers,&#34; Quarles said.

The crisis is further exacerbated by already very high prices of natural gas and cold temperatures. By the end of the month, most of the continent will endure below average temperatures, further increasing power demand.

Europe Certifies Crickets, Worms, And Grasshoppers As Edible Food Amid Soaring Food Prices
<br />
<br />A staggering 6.8% surge in consumer costs is the highest in four decades, making things like food unaffordable because wages haven&#39;t kept pace with inflation. The same is happening for households worldwide. 
<br />
<br />With that in mind, households are likely to substitute popular holiday foods with low-cost items. There&#39;s even a chance that some might resort to eating bugs and worms.
<br />

McDonald&#39;s RATIONS fries in Japan due to supply shortage, with customers only allowed small portions
<br />
<br />Fast food giant McDonald&#39;s is set to limit the portion of fries they offer to customers in Japan as a result of global supply chain issues. 
<br />
<br />McDonald&#39;s Holdings Company Japan said earlier today it would suspend the sale of medium and large-sized french fries for a week starting on Friday due to supply chain bottlenecks.
<br />
<br />The company is seeing delays in potato shipments due to supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as from shipping disruptions in Canada. 
<br />
<br />Despite the potato shortages, the popular fast-food company said that fries will still be sold in small-size portions.

Boeing &amp; Airbus urge delay of 5G — “5G interference could adversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate.”  Heck, if it’s powerful enough to disrupt aircraft, sure makes you wonder about the health effects!
<br />
<br />___
<br />
<br />The world’s two largest planemakers, Boeing and Airbus, have called on the US government to delay the rollout of new 5G cell services next month, citing an “enormous negative impact on the aviation industry.”
<br />In a joint letter to US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the bosses of the two companies warned that “5G interference could adversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate.”
<br />
<br />The letter cited research by trade group Airlines for America, which found that if the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) 5G rules had been in effect in 2019, about 345,000 passenger flights and 5,400 cargo flights would have faced delays, diversions or cancellations.

Unvaccinated man denied access to buy food at Farmers Market in Toronto, Canada
<br />
<br />I have warned for years that FOOD would be the ultimate point of leverage to achieve control over the population.  Now it is here, in front of our faces.
<br />
<br />Props to this guy for standing his ground long enough to document this.  Although, it should be everyone doing this, and not leaving.  This is the point of demarcation for humanity as a slave species -- we simply cannot allow it.  
<br />
<br />“There&#39;s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious—makes you so sick at heart—that you can&#39;t take part. You can&#39;t even passively take part. And you&#39;ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you&#39;ve got to make it stop. And you&#39;ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it that unless you&#39;re free, the machine will be prevented from working at all.”

Restrictions on Cross-State travel, quarantine centers in USA?  
<br />
<br />A screenshot allegedly leaked from the White House’s internal staging site (where content is posted &amp; reviewed before going live on public site) indicates possible future measures in Biden&#39;s &#34;Updated Winter Action Plan” including:  
<br />
<br />- Restrictions on Cross-State Travel
<br />- New Booster Requirements
<br />- See America’s New Quarantine Centers
<br />
<br />I have received this a few times and am willing to share it, but will  qualify:  I cannot verify the authenticity of this screenshot, nor can I find any “Tim Woods” (the name at top left) associated with the administration/fedgov, nor would it make sense for him to leak it with his name on it (!).  That said, <a href="https://login.gov" rel="noopener">login.gov</a> is legit; one might even ask whether this was intentially crafted and released to gaslight the public.  At this point, the fog of war is dense, and it’s getting hard to say . . .
<br />
<br />What do you make of it?

UK faces largest-ever outbreak of bird flu
<br />
<br />“We have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease including introducing housing measures,” said Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss. “However, we are seeing a growing number of bird flu cases both on commercial farms and in backyard birds right across the country.”
<br />
<br />All bird keepers, regardless of the number of birds, are legally required to introduce higher biosecurity standards on farms or small holdings.
<br />
<br />Also, anyone keeping 50 birds or more must register their flocks with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).

Please pay close attention to those who are warning of impending food crises (and then being promptly replaced):

<br />Sri Lanka Agriculture Sect. warns of food crisis before being removed
<br />
<br />Agriculture Secretary Senior Prof. Udith K. Jayasinghe yesterday warned of an imminent food crisis before he was removed from his post. 
<br />
<br />Authorities may have to impose further food rations and seek foreign aid to help feed the most needy, he told reporters.
<br />
<br />“We may have to borrow grains, such as corn, from friendly countries and think of rationing food so that mothers and the sick can be fed,” he said. “Others may have to make sacrifices.” [IAF: if you follow @iceagefarmer you are aware there ARE NO GRAINS to borrow -- this is a WORLDWIDE crisis]
<br />
<br />But within hours, Jayasinghe was replaced by another official, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s office announced, without saying why he was sacked. [IAF: Everything is just fine!]
<br />
<br />Food shortages have been worsened by the Government’s ban on agrochemical imports, which was lifted last month after widespread crop failures and intense farmer protests. [IAF: Much like Botswana banned veg imports, literally citing the “Reset Agenda” — these are ENGINEERED food shortages to force compliance]
<br />
<br />Sri Lanka’s inflation hit a record 11.1% in November, official figures showed Wednesday, as authorities warned a worsening economic crisis could prompt further food rationing. [“Want food?  Get the kill shot.”  “Control food, you control people.”]

China has not been subtle about stockpiling as much of everything as they can get their hands on over the last year and change.
<br />
<br />Their actions are what one would expect to see in advance of a complete collapse in the global supply chain and food supply.
<br />____
<br />
<br />China hoards over half the world&#39;s grain, pushing up global prices
<br />
<br />Less than 20% of the world&#39;s population has managed to stockpile more than half of the globe&#39;s maize and other grains, leading to steep price increases across the planet and dropping more countries into famine.
<br />The hoarding is taking place in China.
<br />
<br />COFCO Group, a major Chinese state-owned food processor, runs one of China&#39;s largest food stockpiling bases, at the port of Dalian, in the northeastern part of the country. It stores beans and grains gathered from home and abroad in 310 huge silos. From there, the calories make their way throughout China via rail and sea.
<br />
<br />China is maintaining its food stockpiles at a &#34;historically high level,&#34; Qin Yuyun, head of grain reserves at the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, told reporters in November. &#34;Our wheat stockpiles can meet demand for one and a half years. There is no problem whatsoever about the supply of food.&#34;

Syria’s wheat production ‘lowest in 50 years’ with fears of mass starvation: UN
<br />
<br />Production declined by over 60 percent in 2021, a grim sign for a country already on the verge of mass starvation.
<br />
<br />The decline in agriculture production comes as Syria suffers from famine-like conditions in parts of the country with over 12.4 million people &#34;food insecure&#34; and around 90 percent of the population living in poverty.
<br />
<br />Besides rising prices, the country suffers from severe food shortages and government-run stores meant to provide subsidised goods are often empty.
<br />
<br />This is just a quarter of Syria&#39;s pre-war wheat production and far below the amount needed to satisfy domestic demand for cereal products like bread.

Israel Bird Flu: A fifth of wild cranes in Israel thought to be infected with fatal bird flu - farmers blamed - egg shortages expected
<br />
<br />Authorities expect to have to clear 25 to 30 tons of crane carcasses after H5N1 virus spread from northern moshav, where farmers failed to report poultry deaths on time
<br />
<br />One in five of the wild cranes living in or migrating through Israel have been infected with the fatal H5N1 bird flu virus, with authorities expecting to have to remove 25 to 30 tons of carcasses, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) said Thursday.
<br />
<br />The virus is believed to have spread from Moshav Margaliot on the Lebanese border, where 244,000 laying hens were housed in 60 coops, supplying six million eggs monthly, out of the 200 million eggs Israelis consume each month.
<br />
<br />According to the Agriculture Ministry, the farmers there failed to report in real-time the rising numbers of poultry deaths, leading to the virus spreading rapidly.
<br />
<br />Many of the chickens were dead by the time ministry inspectors arrived, and the rest were culled. In one coop, only 70 chickens were found alive out of 2,000.
<br />
<br />Agriculture Minister Oded Forer described crowded chicken coops as “a ticking time bomb” that needed to be moved from communities to isolated breeding complexes with strict biological safety levels.

Israel sees egg shortage amid bird flu spreading in hen coops
<br />
<br />The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Rael has stated that the country will face a shortage of millions of eggs due to the outbreak of pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza.
<br />
<br />According to the Xinhua news agency, there would be a 14 million egg shortage per month, out of the 200 million eggs consumed in Israel each month.
<br />
<br />To address the issue, Israeli Agriculture Minister Oded Forer decided to open the Israeli market to duty-free imports of 70 million to 100 million eggs immediately.
<br />
<br />Given the recent outbreak of bird flu in 60 chicken coops in northern and southern Israel, the Ministry of Agriculture has initiated an emergency veterinary procedure to prevent the virus from spreading further.

Massive New Bird Flu Outbreak Could Be 2022’s Deadly Pandemic
<br />
<br />[IAF: keep your eye on this bird flu narrative — remember the predictive headlines we’ve seen in the past (“Apocalyptic Bird Flu May Wipe Out Half of Humanity”)?  ... this could move quickly beyond merely a cover reason to cull millions of chickens …]
<br />___
<br />
<br />Israel’s National Security Council has assumed control of a massive bird flu outbreak in the Galilee, which scientists warn could become a “mass disaster” for humans.
<br />
<br />Over half a billion migrating birds pass through the area every year, heading for warm African winters or balmy European summers, making this a catastrophic location for a major bird flu outbreak—right at the nexus of global avian travel.
<br />
<br />The virus can be deadly if it infects people. The World Health Organization says more than half of the confirmed 863 human cases it has tracked since 2003 proved fatal. Most strains or variants of avian flu, H5N1, are relatively difficult to transmit to people.

Two dams collapsed in the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia over the weekend after weeks of heavy rain. 
<br />
<br />On Saturday night, the Igua dam on the Verruga river near Vitoria da Conquista in southern Bahia collapsed. The second dam broke about 62 miles to the north on Sunday morning. 
<br />
<br />The floods have affected 40 cities throughout Bahia, Gov. Rui Costa said. He said at least 35,000 people had been displaced from their homes. 
<br />
<br />&#34;This is a massive tragedy. I can&#39;t remember seeing anything like this in Bahia&#39;s recent history, given the amount of cities and houses involved. It&#39;s truly terrifying, there are so many houses and streets that are completely underwater,&#34; Costa said.

Farmers, Truckers STOPPED as Food Supply Collapses

<br />As the unv&#39;d are locked out of farmers markets and grocery stores, so too are unv&#39;d farmers precluded from selling their grains.  Ministers who warn of impending food shortages are promptly removed from office.  The mainstream food supply is now in full collapse, and we must be creating ALTERNATIVE food supplies.

<br />Residents under strict lowdown rules in one of China’s largest cities say they are facing starvation after they were banned from going outside to get food.  Before the severe measures were introduced, one member from each household was allowed out once every two days to buy food.
<br />
<br />Xi’an residents took to social media to call for help, saying they were “starving” and asking neighbors to provide supplies for them.
<br />
<br />“I’m about to be starved to death,” wrote one person on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Facebook. “There’s no food, my housing compound won’t let me out, and I’m about to run out of instant noodles… please help!”
<br />
<br />“I don’t want to hear any more about how everything is fine,” said another. “So what if supplies are so abundant – they’re useless if you don’t actually give them to people.”

Driverless truck crosses 80-mile driverless Class 8 pilot in Arizona
<br />
<br />Startup achieves holy grail of autonomous trucking showing ‘commercial maturity’ — bringing in the post-human future.  Burger flipping robots, driverless trucks … can already hear them making the case for UBI…
<br />
<br />_
<br />
<br />TuSimple claims it successfully completed an 80-mile nighttime run on Interstate 10 in Arizona with no driver in the cab — the first to reach the goal in the U.S. among many competitors working on robot-driven trucks.
<br />
<br />The autonomous driving system navigated surface streets, traffic signals, on-ramps, off-ramps, emergency lane vehicles and highway lane changes in open traffic while naturally interacting with other motorists, TuSimple said in a press release.

Pet food manufacturers moving to insect protein.
<br />
<br />This is an entry point to get people eating bugs:
<br />___
<br />
<br />Insect ingredients have been increasingly cropping up in the pet nutrition space, including in pet food and treat formulations. In August, the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) voted to tentatively approve the use of dried black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) in adult dog food, paving the way for more manufacturers to capitalize on this growing meat-free trend.
<br />
<br />Packaged Facts stated this meat-free trend is best applied to pet treats, as complete-and-balanced nutritional requirements for pet food make meatless formulations more complex. Meatless pet treats can be brought to market more easily than meatless pet foods, the market research firm said, and could be an “entry point” for interested manufacturers.

UK Inches Closer To Eliminating Private Car Ownership
<br />
<br />Racing along the path to #AbsoluteZero - Absolute Slavery 
<br />
<br />UK Government Transport Minister Trudy Harrison recently spoke at a mobility conference, addressing the future of personal mobility. In her comments, she said it was necessary to ditch the &#34;20th-century thinking centred around private vehicle ownership and towards greater flexibility, with personal choice and low carbon shared transport.&#34; That’s right, she said the quiet part loud and showed the hand of a growing number of government officials.

Grocery stores introducing armed guards - Gestapo in the supermarket:
<br />
<br />And bigger changes coming to food #retail (click the hashtag) : 
<br />____
<br />
<br />KANSAS CITY (KCTV) -- Hy-Vee is introducing armed security guards to stores across its eight-state region, including in the Kansas City area, the grocery chain announced this week.
<br />
<br />The Hy-Vee Retail Security team will be “specially trained to defuse situations and equipped to protect the safety of both Hy-Vee customers and employees,” the company said in a statement. “The officers have been through training designed by Hy-Vee retail security leaders alongside law enforcement partners.”
<br />
<br />The company said it already has armed security in several stores, and plans to implement the new plan in its other stores “in the near future.”
<br />
<br />Hy-Vee released a video along with the announcement, showing b-roll video of security wearing badges and guns while walking Hy-Vee’s aisles and interacting with customers.
