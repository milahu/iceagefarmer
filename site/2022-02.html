									Massive fire rips through North Carolina fertilizer plant, thousands asked to evacuate over explosion fears
<br />
<br />This is not a coincidence -- this is the war on food production.  We are already low on #fertilizer.
<br />
<br />___
<br />
<br />North Carolina officials are asking thousands living within a one-mile radius of a raging fire at a fertilizer plant in the city of Winston-Salem to evacuate Tuesday amid fears of a large explosion. 
<br />
<br />The fire started Monday night at Weaver Fertilizer Plant on North Cherry Street, and the City of Winston-Salem officials have confirmed small explosions at the plant.
<br />
<br />Winston-Salem firefighters fought the blaze for about two hours before the fire &#34;began affecting a rail car&#34; and at that point &#34;became an explosive hazard,&#34; prompting concerns of an explosion of ammonium nitrate, Battalion Chief Patrick Grubbs, a 15-year veteran of the Winston-Salem Fire Department, said in the latest on-camera update provided to reporters at the scene at about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday. 
<br />
<br />Mayo said Monday evening that fire crews &#34;abandoned&#34; the fire-fighting operation because of the large volume of ammonium nitrate on site.

									Russia stops the export of ammonium nitrate
<br />
<br />With world fertilizer supply running short, nations are taking steps to hold on to whatever they can to ensure their domestic food production will be unaffected this season.
<br />
<br />(Meanwhile fert factories in the US are being burned down...)
<br />___
<br />
<br />“From February 2, a two-month ban on the export of ammonium nitrate comes into force. The corresponding government decree has been signed,” its statement told.
<br />
<br />“This is a temporary measure, the remaining volume can be exported from April 2, when Russian enterprises will receive ammonium nitrate in the required volume, and the demand for it in the domestic market will peak,” said First Deputy Prime Minister Andrey Belousov.

									The Northern Territory’s food shortage crisis has crippled businesses over the last week, with residents posting footage of empty supermarket shelves on social media, pleading for help.
<br />
<br />The Territory has been soaked, with flooding forcing road closures and the destruction of parts of the Trans-Australian railway, dubbed the nation’s “umbilical cord”, stretching supplies.
<br />
<br />“The rainfall received in the area was a 1 in 100 / 200-year event,” Anthony Meere, the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) General Manager said at the time.
<br />
<br />It has become so devastating in South Australia the Defence Force has been called in to fly supplies to Coober Pedy, which has been cut off since last week.
<br />
<br />Simple essential items including milk and meat were included in 20 tonnes of essentials that were flown out by the RAF on Monday — the first of four.

									Aussie Farmer warns farming is becoming economically unviable (as was the plan!), with costs of inputs rising beyond what can be recouped. Farmers are forced to sell off their farms, often to the very technocrats themselves who have perpetrated this:

									Canada euthanizes 12,000 turkeys after discovering bird flu:
<br />
<br />(Remember: animals are “dirty and dangerous,” and we are on the road to the WEF’s post-animal economy!)
<br />
<br />#BirdFlu 
<br />____
<br />
<br />Officials with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency say 12,000 turkeys at a commercial barn in western Nova Scotia had to be euthanized after avian influenza was discovered at the farm.
<br />
<br />The news was revealed during a Friday media briefing. Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a highly contagious viral strain.
<br />
<br />She said there are other commercial producers in the area and that restrictions are in place for commercial operations within 10 kilometres of the affected barn to prevent the virus from spreading.
<br />
<br />&#34;Because this strain is as highly pathogenic as it is, when it hits, sometimes there are no clinical signs other than that the birds are dead,&#34; said McGeoghegan.

									Record profits for Tyson means these prices aren’t reaching the farmers — but the rapidly increasing cost of inputs SURE IS!
<br />
<br />So WE PAY MORE.  Farmers MAKE LESS.  This is the road to owning nothing / corporate ownership of food supply and everything...
<br />
<br />__
<br />Stock of Tyson Foods, the world&#39;s second largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork after Brazil&#39;s JBS S.A., is soaring 9%, hitting an all time high and is one of the S&amp;P&#39;s best companies this morning ... after the company reported blowout earnings (thanks to passing on surging food prices) and announced that it is raising prices even more as it grapples with a tight labor market and smaller livestock herds. According to the report, beef prices jumped by 32% in the quarter, with chicken up ~20% and pork 13%.

									Whatever the threats to the food supply that have been accelerating and accumulating over recent decades, they have been dramatically compounded in the past two years.
<br />
<br />[ excellent article by Robert J. Burrowes, Ph.D ]
<br />
<br />Since the beginning of the so-called pandemic, global supply chains of goods, including food, have been severely disrupted with the intention of forcing them to collapse. This plan has been executed using a careful combination of restrictions implemented by governments, supposedly to contain spread of the non-existent virus. Primarily, it has included forcing workers out of their role in the production, transport and distribution of food supplies.
<br />
<br />Is all of this a total surprise?
<br />
<br />Not if you are aware of the script of the 2015 Center for American Progress simulation ‘Food Chain Reaction: A Global Food Security Game’, or have followed the progressive destruction of the food supply chain in recent years. Watch ‘Farmers Panic, Can’t Get Supplies to Grow Food’.

									U.S. farm income expected to fall 8% as costs for fertilizer, other production expenses climb sharply
<br />
<br />As farming is made economically infeasible, the technocrats seize control of humanity&#39;s food production, ensuring complete slavery. 
<br />
<br />(“Control food, and you control people.&#34; -- Kissinger)

<br />____
<br />
<br />U.S. farmers can expect income from crops and livestock production to tumble, with costs spiking and government payments falling, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says in a forecast for 2022.
<br />
<br />USDA predicts U.S. farm income to fall to $113.7 billion, down $9.7 billion, or  7.9%, from 2021.  Meanwhile, fertilizer costs are up 300% and the costs of herbicides, pesticides and other “crop protection products” are up 100% to 150%. (Yes, yes, time to go organic).
<br />
<br />&#34;It makes you want to throw up,&#34; he said, adding that he expects his fertilizer costs will be $190,000 more than last year&#39;s by the time the season ends.

									Really not good:  further degradation of #fertilizer supply chain:
<br />
<br />Lithuanian Railways has already received an official notification from Belarus that oil products belonging to Poland’s ORLEN Lietuva and fertilizers from Lithuanian company Achema will no longer be able to be transported through Belarus to consumers in Ukraine.
<br />
<br />___
<br />
<br />Belarus since Monday, in response to the blocking of the transit of potash fertiliser through the Baltic port of Klaipėda, has blocked trains with Lithuanian petroleum products and fertilizers, especially those going to Ukraine. For several days now, economists and policymakers in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius have been counting possible economic losses due to their transit war with Belarus. The current crisis in the relations between Minsk and Vilnius was instigated by Lithuania’s ruling coalition, particularly Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė and Foreign Minister Gabriel Landsbergis.

									“Animals are dirty and dangerous!” Propaganda continues: fueled by — you guessed it! — PCR tests. 
<br />
<br />And thus people were herded into the smart cities, away from the dangerous dirty animals! 
<br />
<br />___
<br />White-tailed deer on New York’s Staten Island have become the first known wild animals infected with the Omicron Covid variant, which has already caused a huge wave of infections in humans throughout the world.
<br />
<br />The scientists analyzed blood samples from 131 deer, collected between mid-December and the end of January, to discover that around 15% of the animals had Covid antibodies. Seven out of 68 PCR-tested deer turned out to be infected at the time of testing, with whole-genome sequencing identifying the Omicron variant.
<br />
<br />Some of the Omicron-infected animals were likely to have been previously infected with other Covid variants, which, according to the study, confirms the virus’ ability to effectively evade immune system defenses.
<br />
<br />Further analyses allowed the research team to conclude that the deer caught Omicron from humans, as “the deer Omicron sequences clustered closely with other, recently reported Omicron sequences recovered from infected humans in New York City and elsewhere, consistent with human to deer spillover.”

									Brazilian corn farmers report atrazine shortage, putting safrinha crop (generally their exports) at risk.
<br />
<br />Brazil is a top exporter of corn — without that crop, major issues worldwide:
<br />____
<br />
<br />As Brazilian farmers are planting their safrinha corn crop, they face atrazine shipping delays and unexpected canceled deliveries, according to soybean grower group Aprosoja Brasil and corn lobby Abramilho. The groups say the shortage could put the safrinha corn crop at risk. The leading corn production herbicide is used to control broadleaf weeds, including volunteer soybeans.

									Chicken producers warn about fast-spreading bird flu spreading across US
<br />
<br />US poultry producers are tightening safety measures for their flocks as disease experts warn that wild birds are likely spreading a highly lethal form of avian flu across the country.
<br />
<br />Indiana on Wednesday reported highly pathogenic bird flu on a commercial turkey farm, leading China, South Korea and Mexico to ban poultry imports from the state. The outbreak put the US industry on edge at a time that labor shortages are fueling food inflation.

									Tyson confirms bird flu “detected” within one of their 250,000 bird flocks. Other countries start banning imports from US, the #2 exporter. Big shakeup of world protein supply!

<br />U.S. detects highly lethal bird flu in Tyson Foods chickens
<br />
<br />A flock of about 240,000 chickens owned by Tyson Foods Inc in Kentucky tested positive for a highly lethal form of bird flu, government officials and the company said on Monday, widening an outbreak that threatens the U.S. poultry industry.
<br />
<br />Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky. Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.
<br />
<br />Birds from the infected flock will be culled and will not enter the food system, state officials said.
<br />
<br />Tyson Foods is working with government authorities to prevent the disease from spreading and is heightening safety measures at other local farms, spokesman Gary Mickelson said.
<br />
<br />The disease was also detected in a backyard flock of birds in Fauquier County, Virginia, that have already been culled, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. The cases do not present an immediate public health concern, the agency said.
<br />
<br />The United States is the world&#39;s largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat.
<br />
<br />The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic. Government data showed U.S. frozen chicken supplies were down 14% from a year ago at the end of December while turkey inventories were down 23%.

Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky. The broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials said.</p>

									Canada to seize bank accounts from freedom convoy participants, “to stop financing terrorists.” (This explains the use of terms like “terrorists” and “insurrection” in front of the kids bouncy house.)
<br />
<br />This is such a direct provocation and insult, “please revolt!”
<br />____
<br />
<br />Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s finance minister, later said that banks and other financial institutions in Canada have the authority to “temporarily cease providing financial services where the institution suspects that an account is being used to further the illegal blockades and occupations. This order covers both personal and corporate accounts.”
<br />
<br />Crowd-funding platforms, which protesters have used to sustain their weeks-long demonstrations, would fall under the enforcement of “Canada’s anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules,” Freeland said.
<br />
<br />“These changes cover all forms of transactions,” she said. “The illegal blockades have highlighted the fact that crowd-funding platforms and some of the payment service providers they use are not fully captured under the proceeds of the Crime and Terrorist Financing Act.”

									Ukraine defense ministry reports cyberattack — ATMs are NOT down —  #Cyberpandemic 
<br />
<br />Multiple Ukrainian government websites and banking systems were inaccessible to users Tuesday afternoon. But so far it remains unclear who was behind the disruption, and the overall intent.
<br />
<br />The outage, which impacted the website of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the Armed Services as well as two large Ukrainian banks, Privatbank and Oschadbank, was the result of a digital denial of service attack, according to multiple Ukrainian government agencies.
<br />
<br />The reports quickly generated concern, especially given ongoing U.S. government warnings that Russia might launch a massive cyberattack impacting critical infrastructure in Ukraine, such as communications or banking, prior to an invasion.  #FalseFlag

									Georgia suspends sale of chickens — US’ top poultry producer — as Bird Flu “outbreak” continues in the US.  Animals are dirty and dangerous.  I&#39;ve been saying this was the plan for years, and they are pulling the card now.  
<br />
<br />This coincides with another round of &#34;eat the bugs&#34; propaganda…
<br />
<br />__
<br />Georgia Department of Agriculture suspended the sale of live chickens at trades shows, flea markets and other outlets. It called on growers to implement biosecurity practices to protect their flocks, such as keeping birds inside [IAF: consider how many thousands of operations cannot afford to do this], limiting their exposure to outdoor water sources and maintaining sanitation.
<br />
<br />This strain of the bird flu is highly contagious and deadly to poultry, which is Georgia’s most lucrative farming sector.
<br />
<br />State officials are quarantining the infected operations in Kentucky and Indiana and killing and disposing of the birds to prevent spread of the disease.

									BREAKING: Ports close in Ukraine, and just like that, grain exports to much of the world stop:
<br />
<br />Ukraine&#39;s military has suspended commercial shipping at its ports after Russian forces invaded the country, an adviser to the Ukrainian president&#39;s chief of staff said, stoking fear of supply disruption from the leading grain and oilseeds exporters.
<br />
<br />Russia earlier suspended the movement of commercial vessels in the Azov Sea until further notice, but kept Russian ports in the Black Sea open for navigation, its officials and five grain industry sources said on Thursday.
<br />
<br />Ukraine is a major exporter of corn (maize), much of it destined for China and the European Union. It also competes with Russia to supply wheat to major buyers such as Egypt and Turkey.

									Wheat prices soar as 1/3rd of the world’s wheat exports come from Ukraine/Russia -- 
<br />
<br />___
<br />
<br />Wheat futures prices were up sharply Thursday on the prospect of disrupted supplies and market breakdowns as two of the world’s biggest grain exporters square off.
<br />
<br />Between them, Ukraine and Russia account for nearly a third of the world’s wheat exports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Kyiv is a major source of grain for such key markets as China, Egypt and much of the Middle East.

									China announces “We are more than happy to buy Russia’s wheat.”  Bear in mind they already have more than half of the world’s stocks, and are now reinforcing their own food security by cozying up to Russia.  
<br />____
<br />
<br />On Thursday, China’s customs agency approved imports of wheat from all regions of Russia, giving Putin an alternative to Western markets that might be closed under possible sanctions.
<br />
<br />Russia is one of the world’s biggest wheat producers but has been shut out of China until now due to concern about possible fungus and other contamination.
<br />
<br />The two governments announced an agreement Feb. 8 for China to import Russian wheat and barley after Putin became the highest-profile foreign guest to attend the Beijing Winter Olympics.

<br />Ukraine Invasion Unnerves Global Funds Bracing for Taiwan Risk
<br />
<br />The conflict in Ukraine is sparking renewed jitters about tensions between China and Taiwan, and the worries are showing up in the island’s assets.
<br />
<br />China’s threats to use military force to stop Taiwan from declaring formal independence have dogged the island’s markets for years, and the standoff in Ukraine provides a snapshot of the risks if tensions escalate. Global funds dumped the equivalent of $1.91 billion of Taiwan stocks on Thursday, the biggest one-day withdrawal in a year.

									The plan is to severely limit food supply.
<br />
<br />“Control food, and you control people.” — Kissinger
<br />
<br />____
<br />
<br />SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The federal government says it won’t deliver any water to California farmers because of a severe drought. The decision will force many farmers to plant fewer crops in a region that supplies a quarter of the nation’s food.
<br />
<br />The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said a severe drought plaguing the western United States has left its system of reservoirs depleted. Environmental laws also require the system to have supply to maintain water quality throughout the fragile San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta.
<br />
<br />The bureau said January and February have been the driest ever recorded for the northern Sierra Nevada mountains.

<br />#1 - Moldova-flagged chemical tanker Millennial Spirit, fired upon by a Russian Navy ship 12 nautical miles south of Ukraine’s Yuzhniy port.  However Moldova&#39;s Navy then said &#34;the source of the missile launch is unknown.”

<br />
<br />#3 - [ see previous post ] - Turkish-owned bulk carrier Yasa Jupiter was hit by a missile off the coast of Odessa. The ship is chartered now by Cargill, shipping foodstuffs.

									Merchant ships hit by missiles; Grain/fert exports STOP in Ukraine/Russia
<br />
<br />Ukraine &amp; Russia grains--30% of world global exports--are no longer moving as three merchant ships have been hit by missiles in the Black Sea, including one chartered by Cargill to move grains. Brazil is frantic after fertilizer imports from Russia are threatened. The global food trade is coming to a screeching halt and food prices are exploding even further as the conflict escalates.  Christian breaks down the developments from just the last 48 hours in this Ice Age Farmer special report.

									Russian ship seized in English channel for “violating sanctions”
<br />
<br />A 416ft commercial ship bound for St Petersburg intercepted in English Channel.  Again, this is not a military vessel.
<br />
<br />The vessel, which was intercepted by customs officials, was transporting vehicles from Rouen, in France&#39;s Normandy region. 
<br />
<br />Captain Magnin said the boat is &#39;strongly suspected of being linked to Russian interests targeted by the sanctions&#39;.
<br />
<br />These NWO theatrics are destroying global shipping and the global food supply.  Black Sea shipping has effectively been shut down yesterday after missile strikes hit three merchant vessels , and now, tit-for-tat, the French have seized a Russian ship.
<br />
<br />The Russian embassy in France is seeking explanations from the French authorities.

									WSJ / western media now reporting exactly what I’d said yesterday - this is a shutdown of the shipping arteries that carry global food and fertilizer supplies.
<br />
<br />Now western media can blame Putin for food shortages. Sure, it’s not the Grand Solar Minimum, or insane C19 policies, etc..
<br />
<br />This doesn&#39;t need to become nuclear -- it is enough to be a cover story for why there is no food.

<br />
<br />Russia’s invasion of Ukraine throttled exports from one of the world’s largest grain suppliers after the country’s ports went quiet and traders halted operations. 
<br />
<br />At stake is the 13% of global corn exports and the 12% of wheat that flow from Ukraine. In threatening those flows Moscow risks disrupting supplies to China while setting off a scramble among customers in fragile Middle Eastern economies at a time when food inflation is already high. 
<br />
<br />An ocean vessel chartered by one of the world’s largest food suppliers, Cargill Inc., was hit by a projectile off the coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea on Thursday. Minnesota-based Cargill, which operates an export terminal in Ukraine, said the ship is seaworthy and no one was injured.
<br />
<br />… If the situation on the ground escalates to a position where farmers can’t apply pesticides or fertilizers to their wheat, which will start in March, that could reduce the yield by up to a third, presuming they can harvest in July, Mr. Lee said.

									In her own words, video below: “Dropping Russian banks from the SWIFT system will effectively stop Russian imports and exports.”
<br />
<br />This codifies the blockage of 1/3 of the worlds grain, and considerable fertilizer production.  This is an unrecoverable shock to world food system.
<br />
<br />Focus on your own food sovereignty and security now.
