Pork and meat crisis: Farmers face shooting dead hundreds of thousands of pigs as industry warns of an &#39;acute welfare disaster&#39; due to a shortage of 10,000 butchers and a backlog at abattoirs
<br />
<br /> • The National Farmers&#39; Union warned as many as 150,000 animals are under threat of being culled in ten days
<br />
<br /> • It said a shortage of butchers means farmers are having to &#39;throw pigs in a skip&#39; as they cannot be slaughtered
<br />
<br /> • It comes as a farmer said he already had to slaughter hundreds of piglets due to labour shortages at abattoir

I will concede that “rabid vampire bats” was not on my list of potential black swans for the US dairy/beef supply.  
<br />
<br />But hey, it’s the current year, and the world food supply is breaking — keep your gardens humming!
<br />
<br />__
<br />
<br />There’s an emerging risk to southern U.S. cattle from rabid vampire bats.
<br />
<br />Dr. Joanne Maki, with Boehringer Ingelheim says they’re helping get the word out about the importance of rabies vaccination.
<br />
<br />“Ecologists and wildlife biologists reported data at a meeting last year, it was mentioned, that there have been detections of vampire bats less than 50 miles from the U.S. border in the south of Texas.”
<br />
<br />Maki tells Brownfield Ag News they want livestock producers to know the USDA Wildlife Services has a program in Mexico and now Texas to do surveillance of cattle at sales barns and farms, “With the changing environment, with the decrease in natural bat habitat [IAF: appeal to UN biodiversity SDG], there are a lot of interesting factors going on right now that are encouraging the northward spread of the vampire bat from Mexico towards the southern United States.”
<br />
<br />Maki says damage estimates to cattle in that region if vampire bats take hold is $7 to 9 Million dollars a year. Rabies reduces milk production in dairy cows and stresses beef cattle, harming their ability to put on weight.

How quickly the energy crisis becomes a food crisis — greenhouses in the Netherlands (the 2nd biggest exporter of food worldwide) are being SHUT DOWN as they can’t afford the natural gas to heat them.
<br />
<br />This is just latest perfect throttle on food production!
<br />
<br />#EnergyCrisis 
<br />__
<br />
<br />Skyrocketing power prices are forcing the vast network of Dutch glasshouses -- the continent’s biggest -- to go dark or scale back, threatening to cut supplies at Europe’s fruit and vegetable stalls and flower shops. Although small, the Netherlands is the world’s second-largest exporter of food by value, thanks in part to its high-yielding glasshouses that span some 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) -- about the size of Paris. They grow vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers and bell peppers and flowers including orchids, tulips and chrysanthemums -- making the country one of Europe’s key suppliers of fresh produce and a huge hub for the floral trade.
<br />
<br />“These are drastic measures that reduce production and yield and have major economic consequences for the companies,” … fruit and vegetable shortages could further stoke food inflation, with a United Nations index of world prices hovering near a decade high. Grain harvests were hit by bad weather, shipping costs are soaring and worker shortages abound from farms to restaurants. The energy crunch could exacerbate those problems -- rippling through not just greenhouses, but also costs for fertilizers spread to boost

<br />At Lans, a Maasdijk-based tomato grower producing about 40 million kilograms (80 million pounds) of the vegetable per year, greenhouses are already turning darker. The bulk of its harvest is raised indoors, and normally all the lamps used to sun the vines are turned on as daylight fades in winter. This year, they’re only running at 50% to 80%.  “Eventually, you will produce less,” said Erwin van der Lans, operational director. “That is starting now. Our production is now cut by about 10%, that may go to 20%. Eventually, the customers little by little will start paying more.”

“It emerges the city’s most exalted vegan restaurant has a secret meat room for the mega-rich.”
<br />
<br />Indeed — as meat is made illegal for most of us, the mega rich will continue to eat whatever they want — nevermind carbon allowances!
<br />
<br />Meat for me but none for thee!  Let them eat cake indeed.
<br />_______
<br />
<br />This May chef Daniel Humm had announced with much flowery fanfare that his Eleven Madison Park restaurant would reopen in June from its pandemic closure with a fully plant-based vegan menu. But not just any meager meatless menu: It’s 12 courses for $335.
<br />
<br />Humm hammered his message home by telling the New York Times the restaurant would no longer serve meat or seafood, huffing, “The current food system is simply not sustainable, in so many ways.”
<br />
<br />However, it seems those principles are off the plate in the restaurant’s private dining room — which insiders tell Page Six is targeted to corporate events and is a big money-maker for the establishment.
<br />
<br />The private dining room at Eleven Madison Park comes complete with a meat-heavy menu that includes foie gras, beef tenderloin, roasted chicken and pork.
<br />
<br />New York Times food critic Pete Wells just slaughtered the restaurant in his review, adding at the end, “It’s some kind of metaphor for Manhattan, where there’s always a higher level of luxury, a secret room where the rich eat roasted tenderloin while everybody else gets an eggplant canoe.”

Some commenters asking what is the impact. Here is the impact from Zimbabwe perspective:
<br />
<br />&#34;The continuing declining of world wheat supply is worrying with Russia, a top wheat producer cutting its exports by 12.5 million metric tons to 72.5 million metric tons, the trend is also affecting Canada and USA, who are other top world wheat producers.&#34;
<br />
<br />&#34;World wheat supplies estimates for 2020/1 indicates a decline of 16.6 million tons to 1.066 billion metric tons. 
<br />
<br />Consequently, end products are becoming expensive for the wheat importers worldwide.
<br />
<br />In France, prices of packaged pasta are likely to rise an average 10% to20% due to increases in durum wheat prices, in August, the syndicate of industrial pasta manufacturers in France and the French committee for industrial semonilina said that climate change is endangering the pasta market,&#34; concluded Musarara in a statement.
<br />
<br />Yes, blaming climate change, of course…

Britain faces a ‘double whammy’ of food-price rises that will squeeze consumers already facing drastic hikes in energy and household bills. David Sables, a food industry veteran who helps suppliers negotiate with big firms, said the first set of price hikes were linked to rising cost of commodities, raw materials and labour in recent months.

Youtube’s announcement that they are now removing all antivax content seems to be more of an overall broadening of the censorship net. 
<br />
<br />For example, several of my videos were taken off Youtube last week (one removed without a strike, 2 “channel strikes”, appealing both) — none had anything to do with experimental injections.  Strictly the globocorporate takeover of food!

The UK government is to relax the regulation of gene-edited crops under plans to try and boost productivity and reduce a reliance on pesticides. [IAF: and of course, it has to be done because “global warming.”]
<br />
<br />The first change later this year will remove the existing costs and red
<br />tape for field trials of gene-edited crops, meaning scientists must just
<br />notify Defra of each field trial. The current approvals process can take
<br />up to two months and cost up to £10,000.
<br />
<br />The more significant change will take place next year when the
<br />government will introduce new legislation to regulate gene-edited crops
<br />in the same way as any other new variety created through selective
<br />breeding.
<br />
<br />This could open to the door to the sale of gene-edited crops in the UK,
<br />and to gene editing being allowed in animals. Ministers will review
<br />England’s broad approach to genetically modified organisms.
<br />
<br />The use of gene-editing was restricted while the UK was in the EU after
<br />a 2018 ruling that the technology must be regulated in the same way as
<br />GM. While GM introduces DNA from different species, gene editing
<br />involves using and modifying genes already found in an organism.
<br />
<br />George Eustice, Defra Secretary, said: “Gene editing has the ability to
<br />harness the genetic resources that nature has provided. It is a tool
<br />that could help us in order to tackle some of the biggest challenges
<br />that we face – around food security, climate change and biodiversity
<br />loss.” [IAF: each is a UN SDG.  not a coincidence.]
<br />
<br />The government’s decision comes despite 87% of people and 64% of
<br />businesses responding to the government’s consultation that gene editing
<br />poses a greater risk than naturally bred counterparts.
<br />
<br />Campaigners have argued the exisiting restrictions must remain as the
<br />technology carries unknown risks.
<br />
<br />Farmers welcomed the announcement having pushed for gene-editing
<br />technology for years. “The world’s climate emergency points to the
<br />urgency of applying this technology to farming and this announcement is
<br />an important first step towards a properly functioning legislative
<br />system,” said NFU Vice President Tom Bradshaw.

I want everyone to notice how the media language is changing, because this presages a change in the way the system treats people.  It is fully weaponizing against us all:
<br />
<br />This week the US National Association of Schoolboards asked the FBI to step in and support them to be safe from these increasingly crazy, hostile, violent, extremist parents who don’t want their children to be abused and shot up with experimental injections.  There were media reports, alternating very deliberately between “extremist” and “terrorist” when speaking about CARING PARENTS.  This sets the tone.
<br />
<br />Now we are seeing reports like this one, a Muslim doctor who says “antivaxxers come in and hate me because I have brown skin” — again reinforcing this idea that anyone who questions the PharmaFascism narrative is a hate-fueled, extremist.
<br />
<br />Don’t let this silence you, or they win the association game.  Be yourself.  Be loving.  But be loud.  And REJECT THE TYRANNY.

Good news on a Monday morning: the word is out about a worldwide corporate takeover of the food supply — and people reject it:
<br />
<br />Street and online people’s protests against the “global corporate food empire” greeted the opening of the UN Food Systems Summit (UN FSS), as the Global People’s Summit (GPS) on Food Systems launched a Global Day of Action on the third and final day of its counter-summit to the UN FSS happening virtually and in New York.
<br />
<br />The International League of People’s Struggles (ILPS), International Women’s Alliance and International Migrants Alliance protested in front of the UN headquarters in New York to denounce the corporate capture of the UN and the “global corporate food empire” led by agrochemical, food and agribusiness transnational corporations and multi-billionaire Bill Gates.
<br />
<br />The UN FSS is being criticized by people’s movements and civil society as a platform for consolidating corporate control over food and agriculture and perpetuating neoliberal food systems that have wreaked havoc on the lives of small food producers, especially from the Global South, who supply 80% of the world’s food.
<br />
<br />“We are here to bring the demands of peoples from the Global South for just, equitable, healthy and sustainable food systems to the doorstep of the world’s policymakers. For over a year, the UN has ignored the people’s calls to sever its ties with the World Economic Forum.
<br />
<br />“Instead, it has worked ever closer with the global elite and has co-opted policy frameworks to serve corporate interests. We are here to say, enough! The people will resist this path to greater destruction of our livelihoods, health, cultures and the planet,” said Nina Macapinlac, ILPS North America coordinator.

Even those running the UN Food Systems Summit have become critical of the fact that it is merely a disguise for a corporate takeover.  We must be encouraged that they have, if you will pardon the expression, bit off more than they can chew here:
<br />___
<br />Michael Fakhri, the United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, who acted as an independent official advisor to the summit’s process, also came away critical of the multi-stakeholder structure of the summit.
<br />
<br />“No one has talked about why we’re in the mess we’re in today, and no one talked about who should be held accountable for the mess,” Fakhri told Civil Eats, after observing the day’s speeches. “All they [said] was, ‘everyone needs to be part of the solution.’” Yet casting such a wide, undiscerning net, Fakhri says, results in the “same people that cause the problem being invited to be part of the solution.”
<br />
<br />On multiple occasions, Fakhri says that he pressed members of the summit’s leadership to consider the role of major corporations in shaping food systems, but was often met with pushback.

Big meat companies pushing smaller processors off the shelves -- even as the government gives lip service to diversifying our food systems.
<br />
<br />It&#39;s a worldwide corporate takeover of the food supply, via engineered food shortages.  When you understand this, much of the noise around supply chains and labor/trucking shortages come into focus.

80% of UK food banks expect to run out of food in the near future.  Let that sink in.  We are a hair&#39;s breadth away from lots of hungry people -- not just rising food prices.
<br />
<br />(Remember last year, US food banks stocking up “pandemic pallets” ?  Now we see why.)
<br />
<br />For years I have warned this was in their plan, and encouraged growing gardens and raising animals.  It is still the time to share those seeds with neighbors.  And be ready to defend what you have cultivated.

<br />UK:  Food banks warn of smaller parcels due to supply shortages
<br />Declining stocks and expected higher demand for charity could see struggling families given less in their food parcels
<br />
<br />Food banks have said they will have to shrink the size of the parcels they give to struggling families owing to declining stock levels caused by the HGV crisis, supply shortages and a collapse in public donations.
<br />
<br />A combination of declining food bank stocks and an expected explosion in demand for charity support after universal credit is cut this week has led some to prepare emergency measures to eke out food supplies further, including making parcels smaller and offering less variety.
<br />
<br />Several reported they were already spending hundreds of pounds a month to replenish storerooms depleted by a fall-off in deliveries of surplus food from supermarkets and a big decrease in food donations from the public.
<br />
<br />A survey of 68 UK food banks carried out by the Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan) in mid-September and seen by the Guardian found two-thirds reporting food shortages and more than 80% anticipating running low on food stocks in the near future.

“The Prospect of Domestic Bioterrorism“
<br />
<br />In 1999, a CFR-affiliated author, Jessica Stern, published a piece linking domestic terrorists to biological attacks.
<br />
<br />At the time, the piece went largely unnoticed by the public, as the “domestic terrorism” trope had scarcely even been introduced into mainstream consciousness in those pre-9/11 days.  Yet now, after COVID-19 and the Jan 6 “insurrection,” the article reads quite differently, and I think we should take a look at it and ask some questions (particularly given its genesis in CFR).  
<br />
<br />The document concludes the risk of such attacks “is growing, especially for low-technology attacks such as contaminating food or disseminating biological agents in an enclosed space. Major attacks are also becoming more likely.”
<br />
<br />It further specifies that right-wing Christians (and vets!) are the likely culprit:  “A small but growing number of domestic terrorists could attempt to use biological weapons in the belief that doing so would advance their goals. The most likely are religious and extreme right-wing groups and groups seeking revenge who view secular rulers and the law they uphold as illegitimate. They are unconstrained by fear of government or public backlash, since their actions are carried out to please God and themselves, not to impress a secular constituency.”
<br />
<br />&#34;Asked who he thought the most likely domestic perpetrators of biological terrorism were, John Trochman, a leader of the Montana Militia, said that extremist offshoots of Identity Christian groups are possible candidates, as are disaffected military officers.”
<br />
<br />So:
<br />
<br />- Where does Gates&#39; “Pandemic 2&#34; come from?  The one he claimed that &#34;will get their attention”
<br />
<br />- Why is UK renaming HHS to UK Health Security Agency ?
<br />
<br />- Why such a huge deal about Jan 6?  / Further: Why are all these telegram spammers talking about Trump, and down with Biden? Why maintain this façade of MAGA insurrectionists with bots?
<br />
<br />- Are these narratives on a collision course, set to hybridize into a very weird -- and deadly -- future?  One that would justify violently rounding up any critical thinkers or resistance to their narrative?  
<br />
<br />Some people had speculated that a &#39;antivaxxer false flag&#39; would see gun violence employed against door-to-door vaccination squads, to further demonize &#39;antivaxxers&#39; AND kick off a gun grab.  But is something else much bigger brewing?

Good soil is everything.  Nurture the microbiome there, and it will flow into your own health.  OM — organic matter — is a key:
<br />
<br />- Too much flooding?  - The more OM, the better soil will infiltrate precipitation.
<br />- Not enough rain?  - The more OM, the better soil will hold onto water for your plants
<br />- Growing season variability / early frost / cold temperatures?  - Soil’s ability to hold heat improves with its OM and water content!
<br />
<br />Take care of the soil (OM).  Mix in some EM.   Plop a few heirloom seeds in.  You’ll be amazed at the yields.
<br />
<br />What other tips do you have for folks who are new to raising animals, growing food?

Some commenters asking “what is EM” — great question!  
<br />
<br />EM:  Effective Microorganisms.  
<br />
<br />The most common form, EM1, is a lactobacillus culture (LAB).  Here is Chris Trump (who has many great videos about KNF - Korean Natural Farming)’s video on how to create it.  It’s super easy and one of the single most impactful ways to improve soil health and plant health from germination through pre-harvest.  And totally easy!
<br />
<br />LAB can also be used as a pro-biotic supplement, to naturally clear drain pipes, and about 8 gazillion other uses.  It’s an army of friendlies waiting for you to use them.  Check it out:

Energy Crisis becomes a Food Crisis - Grow Food and Build Local Food Systems Now!
<br />
<br />The energy crisis is quickly becoming a food crisis:  China&#39;s harvest is faltering without electricity. Dutch are unable to heat their greenhouses, which are empty and cold. The UK&#39;s meat production is curtailed by a lack of CO2.  The world&#39;s food supply chains are deteriorating rapidly -- but the tide is turning!  People are more receptive to creative ideas than ever -- build and invest in YOUR food production and local food systems NOW!

Grown men in tears&#39;: Hundreds of pigs culled with farms overcrowded amid butcher shortage
<br />
<br />&#34;These are animals that they have reared, fed, looked after, cared for. To actually then kill something that&#39;s perfectly healthy to then go in the bin - it&#39;s just criminal,&#34; the head of the National Pig Association told Sky News.
<br />
<br />Hundreds of healthy pigs have been culled after a nationwide shortage of abattoir workers left farms overcrowded with animals that could not be sent for slaughter.
<br />
<br />The National Pig Association (NPA) said at least 600 swine had been killed - and fears that the bottleneck in the meat processing industry could see as many as 150,000 affected.
<br />
<br />NPA chief executive Zoe Davies told Sky News she had spoken to &#34;grown men in tears&#34; at the thought of having to carry out the cull - which she has been warning about for weeks.
<br />
<br />The crisis has been blamed on an exodus of eastern European workers, many of whom went back to their home countries after COVID-19 travel restrictions were eased but have not returned.
<br />
<br />That has meant the abattoirs where they worked are operating at as much as 20% below capacity - unable to take as many pigs as normal - leaving farms overcrowded.

[Cereal shortages?]
<br />
<br />Kellogg’s Shares Slip as Cereal-Plant Workers Go on Strike
<br />
<br />Kellogg Co.’s shares slipped as workers at its U.S. cereal plants went on strike, the latest move by unions to seize upon a nationwide labor shortage to press their case for higher pay and improved benefits.
<br />
<br />The strike was called by about 1,400 workers at plants in Omaha, Nebraska; Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; and Memphis, Tennessee. Those locations produce cereals including Rice Krispies, Raisin Bran, Froot Loops, Corn Flakes and Frosted Flakes.
<br />
<br />Kellogg is threatening “to send additional jobs to Mexico if workers do not accept outrageous proposals that take away protections that workers have had for decades,” the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union said in a statement Tuesday. It said the workers “have been working long, hard hours, day in and day out, to produce Kellogg ready-to-eat cereals for American families“ during the Covid pandemic.
<br />
<br />Kellogg said it is “disappointed by the union’s decision to strike.” The maker of Frosted Flakes said its pay and benefits are “among the industry’s best” and that it has offered the union increases to both. The average 2020 earnings of union workers was $120,000, the company said in an emailed statement.
<br />
<br />[IAF:  This figure is skewed somewhat by the CEO’s salary of $12m/year, and 4 other senior execs making another $8m]

At these energy prices, nothing is economically viable.  Everything goes bankrupt.  The food rots in the fields, as it is now in China.  The factories shut down, as they are in Europe.

<br />Dominos Fall As Germany’s Largest Ammonia Producer Slashes Output Amid Energy Crisis 
<br />
<br />A natural gas shortage across Europe has created supply-chain shocks, as seen in the food industry, where problems continue to worsen. European natgas prices are at insane levels, triggering a domino effect of output reduction or closures of fertilizer plants on the continent. 
<br />
<br />Last month, two of the U.K.&#39;s largest fertilizer factories producing 45% of domestic demand closed, and one shortly reopened with government aid. By late month, Austrian fertilizer producer Borealis AG slashed ammonia output after the cost natgas compressed margins in an industry facing tight supplies. 
<br />
<br />As the dominos fall, SKW Piesteritz, Germany&#39;s largest ammonia producer, announced a 20% reduction in ammonia production due to the record-high natgas prices on Tuesday.
<br />
<br />&#34;The level that has now been reached no longer enables economically sensible production, so that we are forced to take this step,&#34; the company told Bloomberg in an emailed statement.

So the US Government has now publically used Google’s search as a massive spy apparatus, with a list of keywords that require Google to turn over identities of anyone who looks for them.  This is really staggering for many reasons.  Yes, we&#39;ve always known that&#39;s what DARPA had envisioned from the get go, but this is a public rollout -- revelation of the method -- of the state watching search queries (which many studies have shown tightly correlated to thoughts.)  This is the state surveilling thoughts and turning over WrongThink offenders !
<br />
<br />- Do Not Use Google.  If you want Google’s search results, use <a href="https://StartPage.com" rel="noopener">StartPage.com</a>, which hits it underneath.  (Google is censored anyway, so this is mostly useful to see what has been removed from the google index)
<br />
<br />- Do Use Tor ( <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" rel="noopener">https://www.torproject.org/</a> ), which is a special Firefox that feels slow because it is routing all your traffic through multiple encrypted tunnels before hitting the destination site, providing a measure of anonymity.  This is still imperfect — actors with state-level resources actors can work to monitor even this.
<br />
<br />- They Own the Digital Space.  There is no true privacy here.  Take it offline.  
<br />
<br />Many of you are smart about this — what other privacy suggestions do you have?

Water Wars:  BC, Canada set to declare 15,000 wells illegal in 2022 
<br />
<br />Starting March 1, 2022, about 15,000 well owners discover their wells are now illegal and could be subject to shut down.
<br />
<br />Users of historical wells going back decades prior to 2016 were given a 2019 deadline to apply, which was later extended to 2022.
<br />
<br />But five months away from it, less than a quarter of the 20,000 users have applied. And many of those who did are waiting years to have applications processed.
<br />
<br />He said there are no indications that the deadline will be extended again, so all users who haven’t applied for licences could see their wells become illegal.
<br />
<br />“The social, economic and political costs of being forced to shut down businesses of 15,000 current groundwater users … are too severe to contemplate,” he told MLAs.

“2021 is a cursed year for Swiss farmers -- Bad harvests tear holes in the farmers&#39; coffers”
<br />
<br />__
<br />The farming year began with a cold spring, then there were frost nights and hailstorms after the start of vegetation. It was followed by a rainy summer with soaked floors. 2021 is a cursed year for Swiss farmers, as Martin Rufer, director of the farmers&#39; association, says.  
<br />
<br />“The heavy rain has meant that the harvest is partly rotten, that partly it could not be harvested in time, for example the grain”, he describes the situation. “And the wet weather also meant that the disease pressure was much higher than in previous years. That was the case with potatoes and vines, for example.

India:  “ambitious” ethanol plan sparks food security fears
<br />
<br />India’s ambitious plan to cut the use of fossil fuels by promoting ethanol derived from rice, corn and sugar is drawing criticism from some experts who warn the move could undermine food security in the world’s second-most populous country.
<br />
<br />In June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration accelerated the nation’s ethanol goal by five years, seeking to double production and to have gasoline 20% blended with the spirit by 2025. To help meet the target, the government is offering financial assistance to biofuel producers and faster environmental clearances. The plan is also resulting in the diversion of food grains meant for the poor to companies at subsidized rates. 
<br />
<br />Even as many developed countries debate limiting policy support for grain-based biofuels amid reports of food-price increases and greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, India is seeing multifold benefits. The government argues that the new target will help the world’s third-largest oil consumer save 300 billion rupees ($4 billion) annually by cutting crude imports, reduce carbon emissions and boost farmers’ incomes. 
<br />
<br />But critics say it’s a self-goal for a country that’s struggled for years to feed its poor. Though the Green Revolution helped boost farm yields and turn India into a net exporter of wheat and rice, it still ranks 94th on the Global Hunger Index 2020 comprising 107 nations. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that about 209 million Indians, or about 15% of its population, were undernourished between 2018 and 2020. The coronavirus pandemic is also pushing more people into poverty, dealing a blow to decades of progress.
<br />
<br />“It will always be the poor who will be affected worse as a result of diverting precious food grains to alternative energy conversion,&#34; said Shanthu Shantharam, who helped formulate the country’s biotechnology regulations in the 1990s and now teaches agricultural biotech at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. “As it is, the food security situation in the country is precarious.&#34;

Worldwide wheat situation continues to deteriorate -- Watch Wheat
<br />
<br />Dry year leaves Syria wheat farmers facing crop failure - up to 95%!!
<br />__
<br />&#34;This year there wasn&#39;t enough rain, and we didn&#39;t harvest any wheat.&#34;
<br />
<br />As man-made climate change [IAF: No, #GrandSolarMinimum, just like happened in the Dalton and Maunder before us, exacerbated by weather warfare] increases the likelihood of drought and wildfires worldwide, Syria has also been hit hard by low rainfall this year, especially in its breadbasket Hasakeh province.
<br />
<br />In the Kurdish-run northeastern region, dismal wheat harvests have raised alarm about food security in a war-torn country where 60 percent of people already struggle to buy food.
<br />
<br />In Hasakeh, humanitarian agencies estimate crop production to have dropped by more than 95 percent compared to last year in large parts of the province.
<br />
<br />Souleiman said the lack of downpour, coupled with the high price of fuel for irrigation, seeds and fertiliser, had made growing the rain-fed cereal a near mission impossible.
<br />
<br />&#34;At this rate, we&#39;ll have to stop growing wheat,&#34; he said in the village of Tal Shaeer.
<br />
<br />&#34;Farmers are going to have to start planting herbs like coriander and cumin because it&#39;s cheaper and they sell for more.&#34;
<br />
<br />&#34;Farming has become a loss-making business,&#34; said the agricultural worker of 45 years in the village of Kardeem Haleema.
<br />
<br />&#34;If there&#39;s no rain this year, most people will move away.&#34;
<br />
<br />Before the war erupted in 2011, Syria produced up to 4 million tonnes of wheat a year -- enough to feed its entire population, but harvests have since plunged to record lows, increasing dependence on imports.

Woman in Renal Failure Denied Life-Saving Procedure Because She’s Unvaccinated

<br />Rarely have doctors ever refused to provide life-saving procedures based on a patient’s personal choices, until now.
<br />
<br />A woman with stage 5 renal failure is being denied life-saving care, not by a single doctor, but by an entire industry in Colorado because she hasn’t taken the COVID-19 vaccine. Leilani Lutali needs a new kidney — and she has a donor — yet UCHealth and others are refusing to perform the transplant because Lutali is religiously opposed to taking the vaccine.

GARDENING IS SO DANGEROUS!
<br />
<br />Just like the “poisonous courgettes” and “Chinese mystery seeds” stories — now we are seeing a huge media blitz around how dangerous POTTING SOIL can be!  Potentially fatal!  
<br />
<br />JUST BUY FROM MONSANTO — it’s SAFE and wrapped in PLASTIC so you don’t have to WORRY…..
<br />   @iceagefarmer
<br />___
<br />
<br />A Melbourne grandfather has died of ­Legionnaires’ disease days after opening a bag of potting mix for his wife.
<br />
<br />In a statement to 7NEWS.com.au, a Department of Health spokesperson said while potting mix may seem harmless “it can be dangerous unless the correct procedures are followed”.
<br />
<br />Giuseppe ‘Beppi’ Trentin, 79, died in hospital last Wednesday - a month shy of his 80th birthday - after he was exposed to legionella bacteria at the couple’s Preston home.
<br />
<br />His son Renato Trentin told 7NEWS.com.au that his mum had been repotting a tomato plant when she asked her husband to grab the bag of potting mix from the garage and open it for her.
<br />
<br />“Mum did all the potting, dad didn’t touch the soil or anything,” he said.
<br />
<br />A few days later, Beppi woke with a fever and was admitted to hospital a week later when his condition deteriorated rapidly.
<br />
<br />The bacteria can be found in tiny quantities in the general environment and do not pose a health hazard, however, the ingredients and dampness of potting mix make it the ideal breeding ground.
<br />
<br />Gardeners are advised to wear a mask and gloves when handling soil, compost or potting mix and wash their hands to minimise the risk of exposure.
<br />
<br />Most people who breathe in the bacteria do not become ill. The risk of disease is increased with age, smoking, and in people with weakened immune systems,” the spokesperson said

“Watch wheat …”
<br />
<br />Global wheat prices up 41% with consumption hitting ‘all-time high’
<br />
<br />Global wheat prices are up 41% on last year due to “tightening export availabilities amid strong demand”, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN has reported this week.
<br />
<br />World wheat prices are up almost 4% in September compared to August. Rice prices also rose in September, while those of maize increased by a moderate 0.3% – averaging 38% higher year-on-year.
<br />
<br />“Among major cereals, wheat will be the focus in the coming weeks as demand needs to be tested against fast rising prices,” FAO senior economist Abdolreza Abbassian said.
<br />
<br />The FAO Meat Price Index was “virtually unchanged in September from the previous month” and up 26.3% on an annualised basis.
<br />
<br />Palm oil prices reached 10-year highs due to “robust global import demand and concerns over migrant labour shortages impacting production” in Malaysia.
<br />
<br />World rapeseed oil prices also “appreciated markedly”

Huge stored food provider, Auguson Farms, ceasing operations for 90 days.  The food supply chain is in shambles.  This is a major red flag, and is about as clear a warning as you can get.
<br />
<br />Strangely, the company even refers to this as a &#34;RESET” …
<br />___
<br />
<br />Storable food mega-supplier Augason Farms has ceased operations for 90 days, citing, “global raw-material shortages” and “substantial delays” in procurement and production.
<br />
<br />“Regrettably, we cannot fulfill your orders on time; therefore, this letter communicates our decision to suspend business for the next 90 days, effective immediately,” says an October 7th, 2021 letter issued by  Augason&#39;s President.
<br />
<br />“During these 90 days, we will secure and stockpile raw materials and take measures to accelerate our round-the-clock production output,” the letter continues. “We are confident that this reset period will help us better serve you with on-time, complete shipments in the future,” the letter adds.
<br />
<br />Are you ready for the food crisis?

Cyberattack shuts down US grain distributor — (this is the third attack/distributor)
<br />
<br />At least three U.S. grain distributors’ systems have been infected with ransomware in recent weeks, raising concerns that hackers have found an easy target in a vital part of the U.S. food supply chain.
<br />
<br />All three known victims are Midwestern grain cooperatives that buy grain from farmers and then process, store and resell it for uses like livestock feed and fuel. The attacks, in which organized cybercriminals lock up organizations’ computers and demand ransom for a program to unlock them, has slowed the distributors’ operations, hampering their ability to quickly process grain as it comes in.
<br />
<br />The timing is particularly bad, said Charles Hurburgh, the head of Iowa State University’s Grain Quality Laboratory. 
<br />
<br />“We’re going into harvest, and right now is when they’re taking in a large amount of grain and putting out a large amount of grain,” Hurburgh said. “It’s a real nasty situation.”
<br />
<br />Like many industries, grain production involves heavily digitized operations that were previously done by hand. Hackers who deploy ransomware, locking up their computers and demanding payment, may not be able to stop the distributors entirely, but they can severely slow them down.
<br />
<br />The largest of the three known victims, New Cooperative in Iowa, is still working to restore automated systems after it was hacked last month, a spokesperson said in a statement. An employee for another, Farmers Cooperative Co., also in Iowa, declined to comment, citing advice from the company’s attorneys. The third, Crystal Valley in Minnesota, didn’t respond to emails and voicemails.
<br />
<br />Private files of all three have been published to ransomware hackers’ websites, which NBC News has viewed, a common tactic for ransomware hackers to deploy against victims who refuse to pay.
<br />
<br />While grain is a key component to the U.S. food supply chain, its market is large enough that the country won’t see a noticeable effect from slowed production by three distributors, Hurburgh said.

Wondering how many people realize this isn&#39;t shortages we are staring down...we are staring down food/water elimination, by design...shortages says temporary, elimination says permanent...we need to prepare for permanent elimination, learn to provide for yourself and those you choose to help. Not trying to sound dramatic but our very existence depends on it...

Lebanon has been left without electricity due to fuel shortages, plunging the country into darkness amid a severe economic crisis.
<br />
<br />A government official told Reuters news agency the country&#39;s two largest power stations, Deir Ammar and Zahrani, had shut down because of a fuel shortage.
<br />
<br />The power grid &#34;completely stopped working at noon today&#34; and was unlikely to restart for several days, he said.
<br />
<br />For the past 18 months Lebanon has endured a severe economic crisis which has got worse amid fuel shortages.
<br />
<br />That crisis has left half its population in poverty, crippled its currency and sparked major demonstrations against politicians.
<br />
<br />A lack of foreign currency meanwhile has made it hard to pay overseas energy suppliers.

1/6 Britons claim they are unable to buy food
<br />
<br />?! - I’d like to see the data on that…. 
<br />
<br />THREAD: Folks in the UK: is this just media pushing a crisis to justify fake food, or are your shelves empty?
<br />__
<br />
<br />Shelves have been left empty across the UK this morning while millions of shoppers claim they have been unable to buy essential foods in the past two weeks, as Britain&#39;s supply chain crisis continues.  
<br />
<br />Pictures show aisles at some supermarkets already stripped bare of meat, fruit and frozen goods as customers were seen pushing trolleys laden with toilet roll and water bottles ahead of the festive season.
<br />
<br />New figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show around one in six Britons have been unable to buy essential food items in the last fortnight in the latest sign of UK panic-buying.

Most comments indicating this is still mostly media hype.
<br />
<br />Which is not to say that there are not supply chain disruptions!  
<br />
<br />I just always ask questions. 
<br />
<br />And right now, the UK media is attempting to engineer a run on the food supply to create even more chaos, as they did with the fuel.

FARMLAND PRICES HITTING UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS
<br />
<br />Top-end farmland is selling at prices never seen before.
<br />
<br />Iowa State University Extension economist Chad Hart says a 76-acre parcel in east-central Iowa sold earlier this month for $26,000 an acre.
<br />
<br />“I won’t necessarily call it crazy because when you think about what’s been happening over the past 12 months, we’ve seen prices basically double and then pull back a little bit. We’ve seen our input costs rise quite a bit, and we’re seeing that same sort of push when we look at the land market these days.”
<br />
<br />He tells Brownfield there should be plenty of sellers in the months ahead.
<br />
<br />“I think that’s sort of the expectation is that we’ve hit a couple of these really high land values, and when we look at some of these sales, that’s going to encourage a fair amount of land to come in. And that’s going to help mitigate some of this price rise that we’ve seen.”

The #AbsoluteZero agenda for decarbonization demands that you give up your gas stove — and use one that depends on the power grid instead.  NPR is happy to tell you why it’s for your own good:
<br />____
<br />
<br />We need to talk about your gas stove, your health and climate change
<br />“TAKE OUT YOUR STOVE QUICK BEFORE IT KILLS YOUR CHILDREN”
<br />
<br />Americans love their gas stoves. It&#39;s a romance fueled by a decades-old &#34;cooking with gas&#34; campaign from utilities that includes vintage advertisements, a cringeworthy 1980s rap video and, more recently, social media personalities. The details have changed over time, but the message is the same: Using a gas stove makes you a better cook.
<br />
<br />But the beloved gas stove has become a focal point in a fight over whether gas should even exist in the 35% of U.S. homes that cook with it.
<br />
<br />Environmental groups are focused on potential health effects. Burning gas emits pollutants that can cause or worsen respiratory illnesses. Residential appliances like gas-powered furnaces and water heaters vent pollution outside, but the stove &#34;is the one gas appliance in your home that is most likely unvented,&#34; says Brady Seals with RMI, formerly Rocky Mountain Institute.
<br />
<br />The focus on possible health risks from stoves is part of the broader campaign by environmentalists to kick gas out of buildings to fight climate change. Commercial and residential buildings account for about 13% of heat-trapping emissions, mainly from the use of gas appliances.
<br />
<br />Kephart [one environmental epidemiologist] has two young children, and research, including this 1992 study, shows that kids who live in a home with a gas stove have about a 20% increased risk of developing respiratory illness.

One of Uruguay’s top agricultural investors is stepping up its exposure to the sector, betting that a multiyear agricultural commodity uptrend will boost farm revenues and property prices. A financial trust sponsored by Agropecuaria del Litoral raised $100 million this week to buy farmland in the South American country, a major producer of beef, milk, rice and soybeans.

Consumers will have to get used to increasing food prices, Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio has warned. Patricio admitted that the world’s fifth-largest food and beverage company has been raising prices of such products as ketchup and baked beans “where necessary around the world.”
<br />
<br />Kraft Heinz has reportedly increased prices for more than half of its products in the US, the company’s home market, and expects to do the same elsewhere.

“It’s a madhouse” - Organic U.S. soy prices hit record, fuel food inflation
<br />
<br />A year ago I went on as many interviews as I could to warn about worldwide soybean shortage, rocketing cost of animal feed, increasing food prices, spilling into all grains.  It&#39;s happening:  food prices at 10-year high, ranchers unable to afford feed for their animals.  Particularly note that there is nowhere left from whence to import soybeans.
<br />______
<br />
<br />CHICAGO (Reuters) – U.S. prices for organic soybeans used to feed livestock and manufacture soy milk have surged to record highs as imports that make up most of the country’s supply have declined, triggering price increases for food including organically raised chicken.
<br />
<br />The costly soybeans and higher-priced organic products are fueling food inflation at a time consumers are eager to eat better and focus on health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The $56 billion U.S. organic food sector is also grappling with a shortage of shipping containers and a tight labor market as global food prices hit a 10-year high.
<br />
<br />Food companies and chicken producers are experiencing bigger sticker shock from prices for organic soybeans, which are shipped in containers, than for the conventional crops shipped in bulk. Regular soy prices are around a seven-year high, rather than an all-time record.
<br />
<br />Organic chicken producers are cutting corporate expenses to offset high feed costs and scrambling to source crops produced in the United States rather than abroad. The U.S. imports about 70% of its organic soybeans, according to industry estimates, and U.S. organic production has not increased enough to keep pace with growing demand.
<br />
<br />Bell &amp; Evans, a 127-year-old Pennsylvania-based chicken producer, feeds organic U.S. crops to 500,000 to 600,000 chickens each week and must compete for soybeans with other buyers that formerly relied on imports, owner Scott Sechler said. The company raised all chicken prices in July and will likely need to raise organic prices again, he said.

Mainstream media continues preparing the script for #AfricanSwineFever to destroy the US pork industry as it did China’s.  
<br />
<br />Please pay special attention to the USDA&#39;s script, below far (which they announced in their ASF wargaming exercises last in 2019), about killing pigs and wild hogs. 
<br />
<br />And just two weeks ago the USDA announced a vaccine candidate for ASF!  
<br />
<br />Yes -- even more significant disruptions to our food supply are in the works!  Get ready!
<br />
<br />#WarOnMeat 
<br />
<br />___
<br />
<br />A DISEASE OUTBREAK blossoms in China. Exactly how it emerges, far from the eyes of any surveilling scientist, no one can quite explain. It spreads with incredible speed, killing in wide swaths, freezing transport and trade, and causing vast economic disruption. Hitchhiking on global travel, it circles the world. There is no cure, and no vaccine. Inevitably, it arrives in the Americas, in July 2021.
<br />
<br />Yup, 2021. The year is not a typo. This outbreak isn’t Covid; it is a parallel, hidden pandemic, a deadly animal disease called African swine fever that was detected in the Dominican Republic in July. African swine fever poses no risk to humans, but it is incredibly destructive to livestock: Those deaths in China were millions of pigs, at least one-quarter—and possibly one-half—of the entire herd of the world’s largest pork producer.
<br />
<br />[IAF: then they make the case for a vaccine]
<br />
<br />As with the Covid pandemic at its start, there is no vaccine—but also as with Covid, there is the glimmer of hope for one, thanks to basic science that has been laying down findings for years without receiving much attention. Two weeks ago, a multinational team led by scientists at the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service announced that they had achieved a vaccine candidate, based on a weakened version of the virus with a key gene deleted, and demonstrated its effectiveness in a field trial, in pigs, in Vietnam.
<br />
<br />“The US is the largest pork exporter in the world,” says Andres Perez, a veterinary epidemiologist and director of the Center for Animal Health and Food Safety at the University of Minnesota. “If African swine fever were to enter the US, there would be an extreme impact on the economy of a number of states. That is why it should be a concern for the public.”
<br />
<br />[IAF:  here is the USDA&#39;s playbook for how to respond to this &#34;inevitable crisis”]
<br />
<br />If the disease were detected in the US, the USDA would oversee comprehensive animal slaughter—delicately called “depopulation”—at the farm where it was found, ones nearby, and also farms that had any contact with the first farm via movement of people, trucks, rented-equipment operators, or field reps. At the same time, the agency would order a “national movement standstill” of all swine in the US (and even swine semen being shipped somewhere) for at least 72 hours. 
<br />
<br />Depending on the location, the agency might also send out teams to hunt feral hogs that might be involved.

White House’s response to supply chain collapse:  “Step it up, y’all!” 
<br />
<br />“The supply chain is essentially in the hands of the private sector, so we need the private sector to step up to help solve these problems. Three of the largest goods carriers in the country, Walmart, FedEx and UPS, will make commitments towards moving to 24/7, working during off peak hours,” a senior administration official said.  [even as the USPS slows down post service]
<br />
<br />UPS and FedEx combined shipped 40 percent of American packages by volume in 2020, according to the White House. 
<br />
<br />“By taking these steps, they’re saying to the rest of the supply chain, you need to move too, let’s step it up,” the official said, adding that Target, Samsung and Home Depot are also moving in the 24/7 direction. 
<br />
<br />Additionally, the Port of Los Angeles will move into 24/7 service. The port of Long Beach has been working 24/7 for the past three weeks, the official said. 
<br />
<br />“Those disruptions in the supply chain don’t go away overnight, but opening up night capacity through that entire chain is the fastest way and the most effective long-term way to actually turn it around,” the official said.

Aldi rolling out AI-supported infrastructure for retail stores, requiring shoppers to bring a cell phone and scan QR codes - first test in Utrecht.  The app also tracks a history of your purchases.
<br />
<br />Locking down access to the prison planet commissary!
<br />
<br />More major changes coming to #retail …
<br />____
<br />
<br />Aldi is testing a completely new concept: Smartphones are becoming a must when shopping
<br />
<br />Aldi wants to achieve the optimized processes using artificial intelligence (AI) and smart solutions. The specific plan: Customers should check in and out using the QR code of a corresponding app. When leaving the store, the customer app should also be used to pay completely contactlessly and automatically.
<br />
<br />Customers can also use the app to request refunds, manage their purchase histories or provide feedback. &#34;Digitization must support our core strategy and make purchasing even easier for our customers,&#34; explains Kashif Ansari, Chief Strategy Officer at ALDI.
<br />
<br />All other processes in the test branch are carried out using sensors in the shelves and the camera technology used in the store, explains Aldi. The cameras would record the shopping movements in the store and assign them to the right customer. For data protection reasons, facial data would be filtered out directly and not processed [IAF: is this supposed to make me feel better?].
<br />
<br />The test will initially start in the Netherlands - in a branch in Utrecht. To this end, Aldi is working with the technology company Trigo, which is developing AI-supported infrastructure for retail stores.
<br />
<br />Initially, the test should run for twelve months. What is on the test bench is whether the automatic payment process simplifies the processes. Specifically, it is about &#34;future uses of the technology&#34;.

Watch #wheat…
<br />
<br />China takes steps to incentivize wheat production in coming season:
<br />
<br />China has raised the mininmum purchasing price for wheat in 2022, as part of an effort to enhance grain security in the country. The National Development and Reform Commission has set the 2022 minimum purchase price for wheat at 2,300 yuan ($357) per tonne, up from 2,260 yuan per tonne in 2021. China buys wheat from farmers at the minimum price when the market price drops below that level in order to support food production. The move came amid a renewed policy focus on food security from the government, and also comes after China raised the 2021 minimum purchasing price for wheat, the first it had increased this price since 2014.

No Vax, No Food arrives first in state of Hessen, Germany (largest city Frankfurt), where grocery stores can now  lock out the unvaccinated by enforcing the 3G rule.
<br />
<br />Now it is in full view for all to see:  it is FOOD that is the ULTIMATE LEVERAGE POINT of the system to enslave humanity.
<br />
<br />We’ve expected this, and it was alluded to in February (as I covered here) by Dominic Raab in the UK — but it is still stunning to see it roll out!  #Deutschland! #Germany 
<br />
<br />via the Bild:
<br />__
<br />The pressure on the unvaccinated grows and grows!
<br />
<br />In Hesse, all retailers, including the supermarket, can now decide for themselves whether they want to implement the 3G rule (vaccinated, tested, recovered) or the 2G rule – so far there have been no access restrictions in supermarkets to give everyone the option of basic services grant.
<br />
<br />The Hessian State Chancellery confirms to BILD that the “2G option model” also applies to the food retail sector.

Flooding in West China Destroys Agricultural Production
<br />
<br />Continuous rainfall for more than ten days has caused the lower reaches of the Luo River in China’s west to spill their banks. Large volumes of floodwater released from upstream have destroyed two dams in one county, and villages are flooded. Local jujube growers and those in animal husbandry have suffered serious losses.
<br />
<br />The autumn harvest is at a severe loss in Dali County of Weinan city, Shaanxi Province, where 108 villages have been affected by floods.
<br />
<br />According to local media reports, Dali County has experienced heavy rains this fall. Water levels in the Wei River and Luo River running across the province have exceeded their warning levels, with some areas experiencing serious floods.
<br />
<br />In Dali’s Zhaodu town, about 29,000 acres of farmland were flooded, and 25,126 people had to be urgently evacuated.
<br />
<br />As to the reason for the flooding, some locals have voiced suspicion that it’s caused by the local authorities intentional release of floodwaters to protect other areas.
<br />
<br />“The village was completely submerged, about two meters (6.6 feet) deep, and the houses and furniture were all immersed in the water,” he said.
<br />
<br />Xue Fei (alias), an animal husbandry farmer in Zhaodu, told The Epoch Times, “The water is rising rapidly, and the time for people to evacuate was very short, in a rush. Cows and pigs were killed by the flood, and the farmers have suffered particularly great losses.”
<br />
<br />Dali County is known for its jujube plantations. Most local villagers grow jujube to support their livelihoods. It’s harvest season now, but the floods have ruined this year’s crop. “The winter jujube in the field is almost completely submerged, and the greenhouses are also completely submerged,” Xin said.
<br />
<br />Xin’s 5-acre plantation of jujube trees was all destroyed after being soaked in floodwater.

<br />This week, the largest US producer of aluminum billet used to make automobiles and building supplies told customers and business associates that output capacity might be curtailed in 2022 due to a lack of magnesium supply.
<br />
<br />&#34;In the last several weeks, magnesium availability has dried up, and we have not been able to purchase our required magnesium units for all of 2022,&#34; Matalco Inc. President Tom Horter said.
<br />
<br />Difficult-to-source supplies of raw materials and soaring energy prices are adding to the headwinds, Horter said in the letter.

More ports are closing due to mandates — effectively forcing Americans strike to cut off their own supply lines. An interesting form of hybrid siege warfare and medical tyranny.

ITALY: fears of food shortages as workers strike at port:
<br />
<br />“ROME, OCT 14 - There are fears of activity at Italy&#39;s ports being blocked and chaos in the transport sector due to possible protests and strikes on Friday, when the Green Pass COVID-19 health passport will become obligatory for Italian places of work.
<br />
<br />    Supply chains could be disrupted due to the new obligation, especially in relation to Trieste, where 40% of the 950 port workers do not have the Green Pass.
<br />
<br />Dockers there have threatened to bring the port to a standstill and have said workers at ports in other cities are likely to protest too.

I live in Italy and can only confirm that this is happening.
<br />Trieste port is one of the most important ports of Europe.
<br />The workers have put the port to a still stand until Draghi abolishes his green pass policy. 
<br />They are firm in their determination and now other Italian ports like Genova are following their courageous example!💪

So what is the impact if that port shuts down?
<br />
<br />&#34;... this port, in fact, represents the supply point of the TAL (Transalpine Oil Pipeline) which connects Trieste with Bavaria and covers 40% of the energy needs derived from oil in Germany (100% in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg) , 90% of Austria and 50% of the Czech Republic&#34; 
<br />
<br />European energy crisis goes nuclear (so to speak): likely fuel shortages, supply chain interruptions, blackouts, interruptions to agriculture, and you can use imagination from there…

UN calls for massive investment in “better food systems” (fake food) at this “critical juncture” (engineered crisis):
<br />
<br />There was a dramatic worsening of world hunger in 2020, much of which was attributed to the fallout of COVID-19, according to the UN&#39;s The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report in July, warning a &#34;critical juncture.&#34;
<br />
<br />The FAO estimates that as much as $40 to $50 billion in annual investments on targeted interventions are needed to end hunger by 2030.

Farmers in California abandoning their fields — the water was cut off.  They have little option.
<br />
<br />Farmers in California&#39;s San Joaquin Valley are abandoning their fields due to drought that resulted in water allotments cut by a third. Farmers in this region, reportedly the most productive agricultural region globally, grow 250 different crops on 17% of the irrigated land in the United States.
<br />
<br />&#34;Our water supply has gotten even more limited. It&#39;s become less reliable and less predictable,&#34; said Joe Del Bosque, owner of Del Bosque Farms.  &#34;We&#39;ve always known that a lack of water is a potential hardship for our farm. But to get to the point where it completely stops the farm — we never thought that would happen,&#34; said Del Bosque.
<br />
<br />&#34;As our food supply shrinks, their food prices are going to increase,&#34; said Del Bosque.

Received this photo multiple times - I do not believe it is current, or even necessarily related to shortages.
<br />
<br />It is, however, a perfect metaphor for our current food supply chain.
<br />
<br />- Crops have been failing.
<br />- Grain reserves are hollowed out.  
<br />- Supply chain in a state of cascading failures.
<br />
<br />The shelves where you are may  still look full (or may not!).  But the reality is we are dangerously close to empty shelves.
<br />
<br />All to convince the public that a climate crisis demands totalitarian response…

As a food producer, I am warning you that you should stock up with tin food, not panic buying, but do it over a few months as things are going to get worse before they get better. Also if you can get a second freezer or one big one.. Some foods will be impossible to get in future.

Australia launching MISSION ZERO decarbonization effort:
<br />
<br />“Australia is one of the best positioned nation on earth to be the worldwide winner in a web zero world, with greater than 672,000 jobs created and $2.1 trillion in financial exercise generated by 2050.”
<br />
<br />Billionaires, blue collar employees, inexperienced teams and the nationwide architect of the blueprint to web zero have all joined forces for Mission Zero — an unprecedented new project that reveals for the primary time the big financial forces Australia might unleash by harnessing the clear vitality revolution.”
<br />
<br />Yeah sure, turning off all industry and Climate Lockdowns will be great for the economy. Just like we flattened the curve in two weeks…

The #AbsoluteZero agenda dictates that all homes will replace gas/oil heating with heat pumps, and all appliances with power grid-dependent versions.  How could this be forced down people’s throats?

<br />Britain to link mortgages to compulsory green home improvements

<br />Home buyers face having to improve the energy efficiency of their new properties under the terms of their mortgage as part of government plans to decarbonise Britain’s housing stock.
<br />
<br />Mortgage lenders will have to disclose the energy efficiency of homes they lend money for and set themselves targets to improve the insulation of buildings in their portfolio.

<br />UK says new taxes will be needed to replace fuel duty in net zero push
<br />
<br />Britain will probably have to introduce new taxes to compensate for the loss of revenues from its shift away from fossil fuels which will hit the government&#39;s income that is currently raised by fuel duty, the finance ministry said on Tuesday.
<br />
<br />&#34;The largest impacts of the transition on the public finances will stem from permanent changes to behaviour that feed through to the tax system,&#34; the ministry said. &#34;Primary among these is the loss of significant amounts of tax revenue as the economy shifts away from the use of fossil fuels.&#34;

Power shortages are turning out streetlights and shutting down factories in China. The poor in Brazil are choosing between paying for food or electricity. German corn and wheat farmers can’t find fertilizer, made using natural gas. And fears are rising that Europe will have to ration electricity if it’s a cold winter.
<br />
<br />The world is gripped by an energy crunch — a fierce squeeze on some of the key markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels that keep the global economy running and the lights and heat on in homes. … The biggest squeeze is on natural gas in Europe, which imports 90% of its supply — largely from Russia — and where prices have risen to five times what they were at the start of the year, to 95 euros from about 19 euros per megawatt hour.
<br />
<br />It’s hitting the Italian food chain hard, with methane prices expected to increase sixfold and push up the cost of drying grains. That could eventually raise the price of bread and pasta at supermarkets, but meat and dairy aisles are more vulnerable as beef and dairy farmers are forced to pay more for grain to feed their animals and pass the cost along to customers.
<br />
<br />“From October we are starting to suffer a lot,” said Valentino Miotto of the AIRES association that represents the grain sector.
<br />
<br />… That left Hermann Greif, a farmer in the village of Pinzberg in Germany’s southern Bavaria region, unexpectedly empty handed when he tried to order fertilizer for next year.
<br />
<br />“There’s no product, no price, not even a contract,” he said. “It’s a situation we’ve never seen before.” One thing is certain: “If I don’t give the crops the food they need, they react with lower yields. It’s as simple as that.”
<br />
<br />High energy prices already were hitting the region’s farmers, who need diesel to operate machinery and heat to keep animals warm, said Greif, who grows corn to feed a bioenergy power facility that feeds emission-free energy into the power grid.

Wild!  Largest hail in Queensland’s history falls, shattering records and damaging property.
<br />
<br />#gsmHail 
<br />__
<br />
<br />“Last night, record-breaking hail lashed parts of central Queensland, with gigantic hailstones measuring 16 centimetres confirmed as the largest ever in Australia&#39;s history.
<br />
<br />The abnormally large hail fell at Yalboroo, north of Mackay, as a supercell thunderstorm passed over the region yesterday at lunchtime.
<br />
<br />The BOM confirmed some were the biggest they&#39;d ever seen in the country, breaking the previous record of 14 centimetres set in Kempsey, regional New South Wales, back in 1999.
<br />Meteorologists said they were expecting some storm activity in Queensland the wake of the severe weather on Monday, however the monstrous hailstones produced were not in the forecast.

Rains delay wheat planting, autumn grain harvest in main production regions of China
<br />
<br />Constant rains in recent weeks have delayed wheat planting in MAIN production regions in China, a government official said on Wednesday.
<br />
<br />China had completed 26% of winter wheat planting across the nation by October 19, slower by 27% than normal years, due to constant rains since September, according to Pan Wenbo, head of the planting management division under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.
<br />
<br />The ministry will take &#34;extraordinary measures&#34; [?!?!] to tackle &#34;unfavourable impact and austere challenges&#34; the rains have posed for harvest and planting, Pan said during a press briefing.
<br />
<br />The comments came as Beijing renewed a policy focus on food security following the COVID-19 pandemic and after prices of corn, the other main grain crop in China, soared on falling inventories and output, pushing up feed use of wheat and grains imports to record high levels.

I’m disturbed to hear talk of FedGov soon to take control of food distribution, and even ration it.  
<br />
<br />They would need a massive media campaign to convince people that there is no other way.  
<br />
<br />They would need to make the case that “some people” are selfish and illogical and hoarding food, and it must be stopped by intervening.  
<br />
<br />They are making this case now…

<br />But there’s plenty of food. There just isn’t always enough processing and transportation capacity to meet rising demand as the economy revs up.

Quality farm equipment is getting hard to find amid the supply chain shortage, many farmers and experts said, and its scarcity is driving up prices and raising questions about whether farmers&#39; harvests and next year&#39;s planting season could be affected.
<br />
<br />Some farmers are concerned that the shortage could grow worse after 10,000 John Deere workers went on strike last week. The company had reported record profits this year, and United Auto Workers union members walked off the job at 14 manufacturing plants when it refused to raise wages above 6 percent.
<br />
<br />&#34;It&#39;s got us worried for sure,&#34; said Eric Hopkins, the senior vice president of Hundley Farms, which boasts 20,000 acres of mostly vegetables in central Florida. &#34;They&#39;re already low on inventory and parts right now. A strike is only going to exacerbate things, make it worse. If it lasts for a while, not only will they not have new tractors, but when you have a breakdown and there&#39;s no parts, your tractor is just going to sit there not being able to harvest or plant a crop.&#34;

Recall that the Rockefeller “Reset the Table” plan includes using schools as Nutritional Hubs for communities, as well as a massive expansion of SNAP/EBT (food stamps).  It’s also an easy appeal to “think of the children.”  So this kind of media messaging is expected:

<br />Supply chain crisis leading to food, supply shortages in schools nationwide
<br />
<br />The supply chain crisis affecting the U.S. economy has now hit school cafeterias and lunchrooms nationwide.
<br />
<br />Many schools are struggling to feed students as delays and supply shortages still continue.
<br />
<br />Dimtra Barrios, the director of food service at the Ridley School District, said, &#34;it’s a daily battle&#34; for schools.
<br />
<br />&#34;We are hoping that deliveries arrive so that we don’t have to adjust our menu to ensure that our students receive meals,&#34; she told FOX Business&#39; Jeff Flock.

“Whoa! We didn’t mean it!” UK deletes documents, reverses course on diet dictatorship:
<br />___
<br />
<br />Climate plan urging plant-based diet shift deleted
<br />
<br />A government research paper recommending people &#34;shift dietary habits&#34; towards plant-based foods has been hastily deleted.
<br />
<br />The paper focuses on changing public behaviour to hit climate targets and also suggests promoting domestic tourism and portraying business travel as an &#34;immoral indulgence&#34;.
<br />
<br />It was deleted soon after publication by the Department for Business. Beis said the paper was academic research and not official policy.
<br />
<br />&#34;We have no plans whatsoever to dictate consumer behaviour in this way. For that reason, our Net Zero Strategy published yesterday contained no such plans,&#34; it said.
<br />
<br />The Behavioural Insights Unit, also known as the Nudge Unit, wrote the document.
<br />
<br />The unit is most known for its role in the design of the sugar levy and early comments on the pandemic &#34;herd immunity&#34; strategy. The document was swiftly deleted and has been replaced with a note saying it was published in error, but BBC News obtained a copy.
<br />
<br />The document recognises that &#34;asking people to directly eat less meat and dairy is a major political challenge&#34;, although a positive portrayal and &#34;smaller asks&#34; may be possible - for example, people learning one new recipe. When talking about flights, the paper suggests &#34;much stronger carbon taxes&#34;.

Salmonella Outbreak in Multiple States Linked to Onions: CDC
<br />
<br />The onions—whole red, white, and yellow varieties—were all imported from Chihuahua, Mexico, and distributed across the United States by ProSource Inc., according to epidemiological and traceback data, per the CDC.
<br />
<br />“The outbreak strain was identified in a sample of cilantro and lime from a restaurant condiment cup collected from a sick person’s home,” the CDC alert reads. “The sick person also reported that the cup contained onions, though none were left in the cup when it was tested.”

NATO Plans AI Strategy, $1B Investment Fund as it Seeks to Stay Ahead in Tech Realm
<br />
<br />NATO will adopt its first strategy on artificial intelligence and launch an innovation fund this week with the aim of investing $1 billion to “futureproof” the 30-nation security pact, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday.
<br />
<br />“We see authoritarian regimes racing to develop new technologies, from artificial intelligence to autonomous systems,” Stoltenberg said at a news conference at the alliance’s Brussels headquarters. [Is the US not an authoritarian regime?]
<br />
<br />U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will join his NATO member counterparts Thursday in Brussels to formally approve the plans during two days of talks.
<br />
<br />Stoltenberg said he expects the new NATO fund to invest in emerging and disruptive technologies. New headquarters and test centers will be set up in both Europe and North America to support the effort, he said.
<br />
<br />“We must keep our technological edge,” Stoltenberg said. “Future conflicts will be fought not just with bullets and bombs but also with bytes and big data.”

My friends, this is no longer Ice Age Farmer words — this is from mainstream (although it echoes my warnings):

<br />Fears grow that global energy crisis could lead to famine in vulnerable nations
<br />
<br />The global energy crisis could escalate into a world food crisis leading to famine in vulnerable countries unless urgent action is taken, one of the world’s biggest producers of fertilizer has warned.
<br />
<br />Svein Tore Holsether, the chief executive of Yara, which produces 8.6 million tonnes of the key fertilizer ingredient ammonia annually, said high gas costs meant it was curbing production in Europe by 40 per cent.
<br />
<br />However, Holsether warned there was no guarantee that process could continue. “It is important to get the message across that the energy crisis now could be the start of a food crisis,” he said.
<br />
<br />“We have to pay special attention to everyone affected by higher utility and food prices, but for some, it is a question of living or not. This is about scenarios of famine and food scarcity.”

NSA Director warns cyberattacks on US Food Supply Chain in past weeks are escalating to become a “National Security Issue” after the attacks on grain companies in recent weeks.
<br />
<br />#Cyberpandemic meets #SupplyChain 
<br />____
<br />
<br />A group of national security agencies have issued an advisory for the potential of ransomware cyberattacks against two U.S. food and agriculture organizations.
<br />
<br />The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and National Security Agency (NSA) says the advisory includes technical details, analysis of the threat and actions to prevent an attack.
<br />
<br />While the release doesn’t identify the targets, the agencies say the attack could be through BlackMatter ransomware, a tool that developers can profit from cybercriminal affiliates who deploy it.
<br />
<br />Rob Joyce, Director of Cybersecurity at NSA, says the threat of cyberattacks has gone beyond impacts to a company but has risen to a national security issue.

Moving the goalpost: as we’ve suspected, CDC mentions today that booster shot may soon be required to be considered “fully vaccinated.” 
<br />
<br />I can only hope this wakes a few hundred million people up.
<br />
<br />&#34;We have not yet changed the definition of &#39;fully vaccinated.&#39; We will continue to look at this. We may need to update our definition of &#39;fully vaccinated&#39; in the future,&#34; CDC director Rochelle Walensky told reporters.

...the Social Credit System is BEING DEPLOYED:
<br />
<br />&#34;A new digital currency can now be used to pay for goods and services in participating businesses in the Guadalajara metropolitan area.
<br />
<br />Pegged 1:1 to the Mexican peso, the hoozie, as the currency is called, was officially launched on Thursday.
<br />
<br />Citizens can obtain hoozies, a blockchain-based currency, by downloading the hoozie app on their cell phones and carrying out certain activities that benefit their communities or the environment.
<br />
<br />Hoozies can also be earned through the use of public transport, running and cycling. Riding a bike for 30 minutes, for example, earns a hoozie app user 10 hoozies. People get 50 hoozies if they sign up a friend to the app and 100 if they sign up a business.
<br />
<br />When people use the digital currency to make purchases in participating businesses, 4% of the value of the transaction is returned to them in hoozies.
<br />
<br />The currency is an initiative of the University of Guadalajara and the Irish company Domila Limited.
<br />
<br />The Jalisco Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology contributed 1.2 million pesos (US $59,500) to aid its development via a funding scheme designed to support initiatives that will help reactive the state economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.
<br />
<br />A pilot program to test the functionality of the new digital currency was run at the 2021 expo of the National Association of Supermarkets and Department Stores (ANTAD), which was held in Guadalajara this week. About 1,800 attendees downloaded the app during the event.&#34;

FBI REACHES OUT TO FARMERS TO PREVENT AGROTERRORISM
<br />
<br />The FBI has been reaching out to help farmers and food processors recognize potential threats to their products and businesses.  Scott Mahloch is an FBI Special Agent with the Weapons of Mass Destruction unit in Milwaukee, and he attended World Dairy Expo in Madison, Wisconsin recently. Mahloch says, “I was able to talk to a lot of farmers, and a lot of family farmers, and they didn’t realize that the FBI has a role when it comes to agricultural defense and agroterrorism, and really, the WMD program as a whole, so it was a great way to spread our message and talk to that audience.”
<br />
<br />Mahloch tells Brownfield potential agroterrorism threats like the intentional adulteration of food or water, or disrupting an agricultural practice can come from almost anywhere or anyone, but the danger is often inside the farm or business. “That insider threat can take the form of many things. It’s that disgruntled employee, it’s somebody that’s maybe having money issues or family issues, or religion might come into play there as well.”
<br />
<br />Mahloch says the FBI works with front-line managers to help them recognize certain behaviors that can tip them off to an insider threat.  He also suggests farmers take steps to secure their stored products like milk, feed, and chemicals, and take time to properly vet potential new employees.

NSA/CISA/EPA warn of rising incidence of Cyberattacks on municipal water and wastewater systems
<br />
<br />The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the FBI issued a joint advisory warning that threat actors are targeting hardware and software that support drinking water and wastewater infrastructure operations. 
<br />
<br />CISA said Thursday that malicious cyber threats to information and operational technology networks, systems and devices could affect the sector&#39;s potable water delivery wastewater management efforts.

Edible Oil Prices Hit Record High As Food Inflation Treat Soars 
<br />
<br />Prices of edible oils have been rising across the world. Palm oil, the world&#39;s most consumed vegetable oil, surged to a new record high, spreading concerns about persistent global food inflation. 
<br />
<br />Malaysia&#39;s palm oil futures soared more than 40% this year, while soybean oil is up more than 50%. Prices of canola oil are also at a record.  
<br />
<br />&#34;There are no stopping prices from going higher&#34; until policies are implemented that are likely to cool the commodity market, such as higher interest rates,&#34; Varqa said.
<br />
<br />… This means that the weight of vegetable oils in the UN&#39;s Food and Agriculture Organization&#39;s FAO Food Price Index will continue to pressure global food prices higher. Last month, the index hit a new decade high, which includes a basket of food commodities (such as cereals, vegetable oils, dairy, meat, and sugar).

“Pigs-in-blanket might be off the Christmas menu”
<br />
<br />This might seem a first world problem: but those little sausages point to a big pressure for farmers, which won’t abate once the Christmas lights come down.
<br />
<br />In Yorkshire - we meet the farmers broken-hearted with the prospect of culling their pigs, who they’ve raised for the meat industry.
<br />
<br />The supply chain crisis has multiple, complex reasons. A shortage of EU workers, leaving parts of the economy exposed - is clearly part of the new reality of Brexit. [IAF: note invocation of “new normal” language here on behalf of WEF]
<br />
<br />It’s a perfect storm. And that’s before you factor in rocketing energy prices, fears over rising inflation and an expected hike in interest rates.
<br />
<br />The government knows it has to respond to the crisis and has brought in a raft of measures, pulling in the military to help with fuel deliveries and easing restrictions on some key workers coming into the country.

DEVELOPING: Tesco says website and app down after hack attempt
<br />
<br />Tesco&#39;s website and app have crashed after what the retail giant said were attempts &#34;to interfere with our systems&#34;.
<br />
<br />The possible hack at Britain&#39;s biggest supermarket began on Saturday with shoppers unable to order goods and track deliveries.
<br />
<br />Tesco initially said there was &#34;an issue&#34;, but in a Sunday update said there had been deliberate disruption.
<br />
<br />The retailer sought to assure customers their data was safe.
<br />
<br />But shoppers have complained about a lack of information, with many wanting to know how to cancel orders and whether they can get money back.
<br />
<br />A Tesco spokesperson said: &#34;There is no reason to believe that this issue impacts customer data and we continue to take ongoing action to make sure all data stays safe.

Skyrocketing fertilizer prices could lead U.S. corn profits to drop by about a quarter next year, potentially motivating farmers to shift millions of acres into less cost-intensive soybeans. 
<br />
<br />Terry Roggensack, agriculture specialist and co-owner of the Hightower Report, predicts corn returns on an operating-cost basis for producers in the U.S., the world’s biggest producer, could plummet to roughly $430 an acre. That compares with about $600 this year. The yellow grain uses more fertilizer than other crops like soybeans and wheat.

US being hit by huge cyber attacks, Microsoft warns
<br />
<br />Hundreds of companies and organisations are being hit by a wave of cyber attacks, Microsoft has warned.
<br />
<br />The hacking appears to be being perpetrated by the same group as led last year’s massive SolarWinds cyber attack, it said.
<br />
<br />This time around, the attacks were looking to target “resellers and other technology service providers” of cloud services, Microsoft wrote in a new blog post.
<br />
<br />It has notified 609 different companies that they have been targeted by the attacks over the summer, the company said. Only a small number of those had actually been successful.
<br />
<br />US officials confirmed to the New York Times that the operation was underway, with one unnamed senior administration official calling it “unsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations that could have been prevented if the cloud service providers had implemented baseline cybersecurity practices.”
<br />
<br />“This recent activity is another indicator that Russia [IAF: it never gets old!] is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling — now or in the future — targets of interest to the Russian government,” Microsoft wrote.

Pushing “GMO food as medicine” — these are absolute abominations, but as the shelves go empty, people will be left with little choice:
<br />
<br />____
<br />Anti-cancer bread and super tomatoes: the GM diet that could transform our health
<br />Could gene edited foods have important health and environmental benefits for post-Brexit Britain? And can we stomach them?
<br />
<br />At Rothamsted Research in Harpenden, there is a set of greenhouses which offer a glimpse of the future. Inside lies a line of wheat plants which have been genetically modified in the hope of creating the world’s first anti-cancer bread.
<br />
<br />The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has removed certain regulatory restrictions which mean that scientists can now apply to conduct field trials of gene edited crops for the purpose of food production. The changes are a direct consequence of Brexit – gene editing is heavily restricted throughout the European Union – but government ministers are keen to press on with exploring the potential environmental and health benefits.
<br />
<br />“It’s a watershed moment for plant science,” says Murray Grant, who studies plant and crop science at the University of Warwick. “One of the great potentials of gene editing is increasing the nutritional value of plants, and thinking about making crops more resistant to climate change. Now scientists can think about taking the knowledge we’ve gained in the lab, and doing this much more rapidly.”
<br />
<br />SUPERTOMATO: Last December, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare authorised the production and sale of a genetically modified tomato which is intended to boost heart health. Scientists at the University of Tsukuba have figured out a way to tweak the tomato genome so that it contains five times the normal amount of an amino acid called GABA, which is thought to lower blood pressure. A spin-off company called Sanatech is now offering the seeds to large-scale producers this autumn, with the intention of reaching Japan’s supermarkets sometime next year.

Will the Run Up in Retail Meat Prices Continue? USDA Thinks So!
<br />
<br />The price shoppers pay for items like meat at the grocery store are expected to continue the rapid rise. An updated Consumer Price Index (CPI) released from USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) shows wholesale beef prices climbed 14.2% from July to August of 2021, and price projections point to a possible 20% increase in wholesale beef prices this year.
<br />
<br />The price projections released are for a wide variety of grocery store items. According to Farm Journal Washington Correspondent Jim Wiesemeyer, meat prices are expected to see the largest increase.
<br />
<br />The updated ERS forecast shows prices for meats, poultry and fish now sits at 4.5% to 5.5%, which is up from the 4% to 5% posted last month. He says the main drivers are higher beef and pork prices.

Vegetable crops, glasshouses and wine grapes north of Adelaide damaged in hailstorm
<br />
<br />Among the most affected vegetable crops were lettuces, tomatoes, cucumbers and zucchinis, many of which are grown in glasshouses around Virginia, about 30 kilometres north-west of the Adelaide CBD.
<br />
<br />Phan Le estimated the damage to his glasshouses and crops at $200,000, with almost all of his tomatoes ruined.

Sounds like good news - but for MOST farmers (and MOST people who need their food) - this is a problem, beyond RoundUp.
<br />
<br />Glyphosate Prices Soar As Much As 300%, And That&#39;s If You Can Even Get It
<br />
<br />The input price scenario for 2022 is growing more complicated and scary by the week. Farmers are already preparing for added costs to grow a crop next year, but even today’s prices may be an accurate snapshot for 2022 potential budgets. That’s because input prices continue to climb by the day.
<br />
<br />From nitrogen to glyphosate, prices are posting 100% to 300% increases right now. Some farmers say they can’t even get retailers to price product until the inputs actually arrive at the retail facilities. [IAF: this means less food, and much more expensive]
<br />
<br />One farmer told Farm Journal he priced anhydrous ammonia last week. For a fall application prices currently sit at $1,250 per ton. Just this past spring, prices were $580 for prepay or $650 to $675 per ton for in-season purchases. He was told by this spring, prices could reach $1,400 per ton.
<br />
<br />Extreme weather, combined with an energy crunch in China and Europe, are creating rising fertilizer prices around the globe. Higher natural gas prices are adding to the situation, as the issues just keep piling up.

Remarkable: adding EXTRA costs to the already fubar’d supply chain!

<br />The surprise decision by the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach this week to impose hefty surcharges on ocean carriers that take too long removing containers from overcrowded terminals has raised more questions than answers. Freight industry professionals — and the Federal Maritime Commission — want to know where the twin ports are getting the authority  to levy the surcharges.

Meat is dangerous.  They REALLY want you to believe that, so they can feed you the bug burgers …
<br />
<br />__
<br />COVID-19 Infections and Deaths at Meatpacking Plants Much Higher Than Previously Thought
<br />
<br />This week, that subcommittee released the results of an investigation into meatpacking plants, and it found that the number of COVID-19 deaths and infections at many of the largest plants was much higher than previously reported—in some cases, several times higher.
<br />
<br />The Congressional subcommittee’s investigation led it to internal documents from the major players in American meatpacking—JBS, Tyson, Cargill, Smithfield and National Beef—which had previously not been public. It found about 59,000 positive cases at plants run by those companies between March 2020 and February 2021, with some plants having COVID-19 infection rates of around 50 percent. At least 269 deaths of plant workers can also be attributed to COVID-19, according to the subcommittee’s report.
<br />
<br />In any case, the subcommittee also dug up some other disturbing evidence. According to the report: “An internal document from Tyson obtained by the Select Subcommittee shows that, on March 20, 2020, Tyson had not begun to conduct temperature checks, but it nonetheless was telling its workers: ‘It is vital that you come to work as planned, despite stories about ‘shelter in place.’’” Other documents revealed ineffective barriers created from plastic bags, dirty protective gear and statements from plant management that seem to disparage and resist efforts by the CDC to create a safer work environment.

Shipping Companies Fear ‘Catastrophic’ Supply Chain Fallout Over New California Port Fees
<br />
<br />Top shipping officials this week said that a Biden administration-backed plan to issue emergency fees for containers lingering too long won’t work and will lead to chaos.
<br />
<br />Earlier this week, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in California announced they would fine ocean carriers for containers that stay too long at port terminals. They said the move is designed to alleviate supply-chain bottlenecks, coming after President Joe Biden pressed the heads of the California ports to move to 24/7 operation.
<br />
<br />“We must expedite the movement of cargo through the ports to work down the number of ships at anchor,” Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said in a news release about the fine. Starting next month, port officials will charge $100 per container that lingers after nine days by truck and six days by rail, increasing $100 every day.
<br />
<br />But two days later, the officials who attended a meeting of the National Shippers Advisory Council (NSAC)—comprised of 12 importers and 12 exporters including Walmart, Amazon, and Home Depot—said the port fees are “crazy” and “catastrophic.”

Remember - the matrix of mind control is collapsing. In this regard, turbulence is expected, and good news.  How can you ease the transition to a new reality?  What are you growing? How are you freeing others from the system? Lead by example!

<br />Becky Button at the Earlham Mill is making sure more people can get the lumber they need amid the shortage, by making urban lumber; wood cut out of trees that were grown within city limits.
<br />
<br />&#34;Knowing that other people are kind of following the lead kind of makes me feel good and as a woman, there aren&#39;t many woman sawyers, it makes me feel good that I can lead by example,&#34; Button said.
<br />
<br />You can find the wood at ReStores in the Des Moines metro. The urban lumber is not for structural use, but it is for making furniture, flooring or anything else you can think up.
<br />
<br />A purchase supports the environment and helps Habitat for Humanity&#39;s mission of helping build homes, communities and hope.
