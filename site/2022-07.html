Libya declares force majeure on oil exports after weeks of protests and port blockades.  
<br />
<br />This is major news on its own, but also needs to be considered from Europe&#39;s perspective:
<br />
<br />- 6% of EU oil &amp; gas imports are from Libya and were just taken off the table. 
<br />- 34% of EU oil and 55% of gas comes from Russia, which is being throttled 
<br />- Freeport terminal in TX was blown up and cannot send LNG 
<br />- UK just announced they&#39;d stop gas exports to EU if there were shortages
<br />- EU and UK are both frantically burning gas just to generate electricity now, instead of storing for the winter ahead!
<br />
<br />- Greenhouses, food plants and facilities are ALREADY SHUT DOWN due to the cost of energy — and somehow things keep blowing up!  This is an absolute CONTROLLED DEMOLITION.
<br />
<br />Europe is being strangled !!
<br />

CO2 shortage threatens New Zealand chicken supplies
<br />
<br />Plans are in progress to reduce production of some chicken products, according to the country’s leading poultry meat producer.
<br />
<br />Tegel is warning that it may not be able to produce some chicken products because of a shortage of carbon dioxide gas in New Zealand that is also threatening brewers and fizzy drinks makers.
<br />
<br />The Food and Grocery Council said the availability of cheese, preserved meats, sparkling wine and ready-to-eat meals could also suffer, with price rises possible.
<br />
<br />The Brewers Association and the Beverage Council separately voiced concerns about the gas shortage on Saturday.
<br />
<br />Carbon dioxide (CO2) is used widely in the food industry – including in packaging to preserve the shelf life of chicken – and to add fizz to drinks, as well as in other industries such as healthcare.
<br />
<br />Businesses used to get much of their CO2 supply from the Marsden Point oil refinery, which produced CO2 as a by-product of its refining operation until that was replaced in favor of importing energy.

Police have now fired upon farmers in tractors in the #Netherlands:
<br />
<br />An official investigation is underway after Dutch police fired live shots at anti-green agenda protesters in the Netherlands.
<br />____
<br />
<br />... Farmers are protesting new policies which &#34;will lead to at least 30% of Dutch farms being put out of business as they’re forced to cut the number of livestock by the same figure.&#34;
<br />
<br />Anger has intensified after the government revealed the same nitrogen cuts, being proposed in the name of fighting climate change, won’t be applied to the airline industry.

Unscheduled power outages result in high chicken mortalities - some farmers give up as Incubators run cold, freezers full of product thaw out, and losses mount.
<br />
<br />__
<br />Power grid “Load shedding” drops certain zones deemed non-critical — but this is causing farmers to lose their animals!
<br />
<br />Deidre Carter, CEO of Agri Limpopo, said one of the organisation’s members had reported losing about 2 000 broiler chickens in a single day due to Eskom’s unilateral load-reduction strategy, while another had decided to leave the poultry industry altogether.
<br />
<br />“Load reduction is a lot worse than [rolling blackouts], because one never knows when or how long the power will be out,” she told Farmer’s Weekly.

EXPERTS WARN: MASK UP IN THE GARDEN!
<br />
<br />This explosion of cardiac issues? It’s because people started gardening during the pandemic.  
<br />
<br />Gardening is DIRTY and DANGEROUS and can KILL YOU — you should ONLY eat fake meat and bugs.  NEVER GARDEN.  You will be SAFE inside away from DIRTY animals and DANGEROUS soil.
<br />
<br />[These people will stop at nothing to control your food supply!]

<br />Urgent warning to gardeners as soil ‘increases risk of killer heart disease’
<br />
<br />Medics found that pollutants in the soil could have a &#39;detrimental effect on the cardiovascular system&#39;.  “Contaminated soil could lead to increasing oxidative stress in the blood vessels, which in turn leads to heart disease.”
<br />
<br />Dirty soil can get into the blood stream, through inhalation.

AWFUL:  animal feed shortages reported in the USA as deliveries remain scarce:  
<br />
<br />”The point has been reached when millions of chickens will be killed and other livestock will suffer because of UP’s [IAF: that is WEF partner Union Pacific] service failures,” Foster Farms wrote in its request to the Surface Transportation Board this week. 
<br />
<br />Rail bottlenecks in the U.S. are not improving, and in some cases, growing more severe. Feed users in California and the Southwest are having issues sourcing grain, with some reporting they are paying $3 over the CBOT price to secure grain by truck. Not only are feed users on the brink of running out of grain, but there are also concerns the rail issues could grow worse during harvest this fall.

European energy crisis has boiled over — things on the continent are about to change, rapidly and more absolutely than most can imagine:
<br />
<br />- Germany: is restricting when and how energy companies can declare force majeure;
<br />
<br />- France: has just nationalized the nation’s largest energy company, EDF;
<br />
<br />- UK: announced they, too, would simply cut off natgas to the EU when supply is short;
<br />
<br />- The EU has decided that nuclear and natural gas energy are “green” after all, a semantic change which only marginally lengthens the runway for their ‘decarbonization transition’
<br />
<br />These are major moves that signal the hard landing ahead — brace for impact, my friends.

UK dairy farmers warn of price rises amid chronic staff shortages
<br />
<br />Dairy farmers are warning that a chronic shortage of workers is hitting milk production and further fuelling food price inflation, and are calling for urgent action to stop the situation getting worse.
<br />
<br />Eight in 10 farm owners looking for workers said they had received very few or zero applications from people with the right experience or qualifications, in response to a survey by Arla Foods, the UK’s largest dairy co-operative.

Cattle producers struggling with high cost of feed
<br />
<br />“Most beef producers in this area have their cattle out on grass now, so they don’t have to buy hay or grain. But it’s going to be a problem in the fall; it’s difficult to make a profit in this business when you have to pay $8 or $9 for a bushel of grain to help these cattle through the cold winters,” Balicki said. “And, you do have to give cattle grain in this part of the world, because they need the energy to keep warm. So that’s a huge concern.”

<br />This is the destruction of farming and ranching as a hostile takeover of human food production.

Ghana:  food shortages hit schools as students drink porridge without bread and sugar
<br />
<br />There appears to be a serious food shortage in Senior High Schools in the country. This is a result of the poor food supply situation in the schools which is reported to have reached dire and deteriorated levels.
<br />
<br />He said the students are given porridge without milk, sugar, and bread adding that &#34;Dear parents, these are our boys, and as a parents association, we have less than GH¢1,000 in our coffers. What can this do?&#34;
<br />
<br />The Headmaster of St Augustine&#39;s, Henry Arthur-Gyan, also said the school had no option but to manage the situation.  &#34;We know there are challenges and so we manage with what we are provided. There is not much we can do about it,&#34; he stated.
<br />
<br />[ @iceagefarmer note:  expect media to play up school food shortages as a key concept in the Rockefeller ‘Reset the Table’ agenda is to use schools as “nutritional hubs” for communities ]

“What happens after they burn down the farms?&#34; 
<br />
<br />ANSWER:
<br />
<br />EU’s Plan to Replace Farms – CITIES2030 – Digital Twin of Food Supply (nov 2021)
<br />
<br />As our food supply is systematically dismantled, the EU is funding a project to create “Urban Food Systems” and a blockchain-based “digital twin” platform to track indoor farming and synthetic meat from laboratory to plate to sewers. Is this an organic response to a crisis, or a nefarious plan, generations in the making, being realized before our eyes? Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

<br />The onion harvest in the southern Italian province of Bari is underway and it appears that yields are already declining. &#34;We are now in the middle of the harvest and we are trying to move up a gear to get ahead of any weather change. We needed rain in April and May, not now,&#34; said Vito Abrusci, director of the growers&#39; association La Vera Cipolla Rossa di Acquaviva delle Fonti.

Cattle industry leader Corbitt Wall, host of the FEEDER FLASH at NationalBeefWire.com gives an update on drought conditions across Texas. In his words, the effects of this drought combined with economic factors (fuel and fertilizer prices) are "unbelievable" with 3 mile line of trailers for the dropoff line at Emory Texas sale barn. The sale barn received such a surplus that they were auctioning off cattle through 5am the next morning.
This sale barn was 30 miles south of me.  My local sale barn was packed and I was an eyewitness to these unbelievable lines..  It is real.
