    <content type="html">Persistent drought conditions and high winds are creating dangerous harvest conditions for Missouri farmers.

Missouri farmer Robert Schmidt says there were several combine fires across the state over the weekend, including one near his farm. ‚ÄúThe farmer was able to get out some of the crops from the 800 acres that burned. The fire put itself out with the help of the fire department containing it to a wetland area.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe best thing we can get is many hours of steady rainfall to soak into the soil profile.‚Äù According to the latest U.S. Drought Monitor, all of Missouri is categorized as abnormally dry to exceptional drought, with 14 percent in extreme to exceptional drought.

    <content type="html">U.S. winter wheat farmers plant into dust as Plains drought persists

"It's sort of a grim situation," said Kent Winter, who farms in Andale, Kansas, outside Wichita. He said he normally seeds by mid-October but has yet to plant any.

[ IceAgeFarmer note:  I have never before seen #wheat trending on twitter ‚Ä¶ ]

The 2023 U.S. hard red winter wheat crop is already being hobbled by drought in the heart of the southern Plains, wheat experts said.

Planting plans may be scaled back in the U.S. breadbasket despite historically high prices for this time of year, reflecting rising global demand and thin world wheat supplies projected to end the 2022/23 marketing year at a six-year low. The tight supplies have been exacerbated as the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted grain exports from the Black Sea region.

The drought threatens Kansas, the top winter wheat growing state, and Oklahoma in two ways: discouraging farmers who have not yet planted from trying, while threatening crops already in the ground from developing properly.

    <content type="html">Empty Shelves as Inflation Leaves Products Unprofitable

‚ÄúNot only Mars [who worked hand in hand with Rockefeller Foundation on "Reset the Table‚Äù], but also Coca Cola [WEF partner] or Procter &amp; Gamble [WEF Partner]  are currently trying to ride the wave of inflation with excessive price demands in order to increase their returns,‚Äù a spokesman for the Edaka chain of supermarkets claimed.

The official went on to claim that a number of major companies have now halted deliveries to the chain, something that they alleged is being used to put pressure on supermarkets.

[IceAgeFarmer: the Rockefeller/WEF partners are squeezing you as hard as they can.]

‚Äî‚Äî

Products ranging from Kellogg‚Äôs cornflakes to Coca Cola have disappeared from supermarkets throughout Germany, with many shops being left with empty shelves as products become simply unprofitable to sell due to differentials in inflation.

It comes as overall inflation hit 10% in the country in September, with EU-wide inflation for the month falling just short of 11% as a result of the ongoing #EnergyCrisis, which has in turn hiked the cost of food and other essential goods.

Retailers in the country however have strongly resisted this, with one supermarket chain in the country going so far as to accuse major companies of ‚Äúprice gouging‚Äù and ‚Äúusury‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe situation in the industry is critical to catastrophic,‚Äù Federal Association of the Food Industry general manager Christoph Minhoff remarked regarding the feud, which has seen some individual rows even reportedly ending up in court as companies are unable to come to a compromise.

As a result of these ongoing hostilities between supermarkets and producers, a wide variety of well-known brands have disappeared from supermarkets throughout Germany, leaving many shops with empty shelves.

The likes of Coca Cola, Pepsi, Snickers, Kellogg‚Äôs Cornflakes, Milka Chocolate, Ritter Sport chocolate, Wrigley‚Äôs chewing gum, along with many other products ranging from mayonnaise to pet food have all been affected, though availability reportedly varies between supermarket chains.

    <content type="html">‚ÄúMany agrifood sectors are now  controlled by just four to six dominant firms, enabling these companies to wield enormous influence over markets, agricultural research and policy-development, which undermines food sovereignty.

2020 was a horrific year for food security and health ‚Äì but a bonanza for Big Food and Big Ag. Food Barons made the most of the converging crises in order to tighten their grip on every link in the Industrial Food Chain. In doing so, they undermine the rights of peasants, smallholders, fishers and pastoralists to produce food for their own communities and many others.

The Food Barrons are accelerating digitalization of food and agriculture across the chain in order to hold on to, naturalize and expand their power, despite their many failings.

It‚Äôs time to divest from the Industrial Food Chain.‚Äù

    <content type="html">Good piece : BIG VEGANISM is cover for corporate takeover of food production!

‚ÄúMultinationals love the phrase ‚Äúplant-based‚Äù because it is a euphemism for the messianic, cultish, modish cause they have adopted: veganism.‚Äù

Some of the alt-protein research in Food Valley is directed towards consuming insects (‚Äúentomophagy‚Äù); some is more focused on algae, fungi ‚Äî¬†or mycobacterial this, that and the other. But the big research bucks are flowing one way only, and that is to plant-based alternatives to meat.

    <content type="html">Power down? Try salt curing for a low-electricity alternative

Power cuts, rationing or sky-high energy prices? Who knows what this season will hold. Cooking without power may sound apocalyptic, but there are plenty of ways to get creative in the kitchen, all while keeping electricity use to a minimum.

One alternative is to cure food with salt.

From a chemical point of view, salt also has hygroscopic properties. When in contact with moist food, salt has the ability to absorb the water contained in the food. And it is this phenomenon that is interesting to note when it comes to cutting power use.

    <content type="html">The BASF keystone:  as goes the gas, so goes BASF, so goes Germany, so goes Europe . . .

"Everything is connected at the German chemical firm BASF‚Äôs Ludwigshafen site, a 10 sq km industrial complex so large that byproducts from making ammonia, for example, are funnelled through a 1,771-mile pipe network to produce fertiliser, disinfectant, diesel exhaust fluid, or CO2 for fizzy drinks.

The plant is a giant integrated process ‚Äî and it cannot run without a supply of natural gas.

‚ÄúOnce we can receive &lt; 50% of our maximum requirements, we would need to wind down the entire site,‚Äù says a  spokesperson.

The consequences of a BASF shutdown would be far-reaching, not just in Germany but the entire continent.

BASF-produced chemicals are used to make anything from toothpaste to vitamins, [and animal feed]. It's a top manufacturer of painkillers, and its largest customer industry is the automobile industry [‚Äî and AdBlue, which is required to run diesel engines, and keep trucking running ... ].

Gabe Brown on Regenerative Solutions to Modern Problems ‚Äì Ice Age Farmer Podcast

Gabe Brown of Browns Ranch ‚Äî a pioneer of the soil-health movement and regenerative practices ‚Äî joins Christian to discuss regenerative practices and soil health as the bottom line solutions to the myriad problems we face. We discuss the Covid19 pandemic and what we can learn from it, how healthy living soil helped Brown‚Äôs Ranch weather the difficult, cold and wet 2019 season in North Dakota ‚Äî and can do the same for you! Producers from homesteaders/gardeners to larger farmer ranchers can start improving their operations immediately without huge capital investment. Gabe also describes how they have actually been getting a boost in sales due to their direct-to-market approach. And of course we describe the 6 rules for building amazing soil and growing lots of food!

"The most central thing in human life, food, is undergoing a huge transformation right now and thinking about what will be on our plates and how it got there is exciting to say the least.

..."Alternative proteins such as insects, lab-grown meat and new technologies such as producing proteins from carbon dioxide and water will be a complement on our plates in 18 years but not be the main source of protein. "

    <content type="html">More food infrastructure burning - Canadian bridge causes grains transport issues:

‚ÄúAn entire economy is relying on these little ribbons of steel through Canada'

A bridge burned down on the Canadian National Railway Co. line, about 95 kilometres to the south, severing the only rail link in or out of Grande Prairie and causing backlogs for the grain shippers who depend on that track to get their product to port.

CN said the severed line only moves a fraction of the total grain coming off fields in Western Canada. But for grain farmers and exporters, the bridge fire was another example of the fragility of the national supply lines that connect one of the world‚Äôs most important bread baskets with seaports and global markets.

    <content type="html">Force majeure declarations have begun due to barges stopped in Mississippi due to low water levels

This affects not just the grains harvest, but fertilizer applications.

A logjam of ships, tugboats and barges due to low water levels on the Mississippi River is threatening to grind trade of grains, fertilizer and other goods to a halt, Bloomberg reports. Ingram Barge Company, the largest U.S. barge operator, declared force majeure in a letter to customers due to ‚Äúnear-historic‚Äù low water conditions on the Mississippi River. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Coast Guard said there was a queue of 122 vessels at Stack Island and 15 vessels at Memphis. Due to increased groundings, the number of vessels in tow is being restricted.

    <content type="html">Unbelievable - Terrible timing to not be able to export grains/oilseeds:

U.S. barge backlog swells on parched Mississippi River

Commercial barge traffic on southern stretches of the Mississippi River was at a standstill on Tuesday as low water levels halted shipments of grain, fertilizer and other commodities on the critical waterway, shipping sources said.

The supply chain snarl comes just as harvesting of corn and soybeans, the largest U.S. cash crops, is ramping up and as tight global supplies and strong demand for food and fuel have sent inflation soaring.

Around 100 tow boats hauling some 1,600 barges were lined up for miles waiting to pass through one trouble spot near Lake Providence, Louisiana, that has been largely closed since late last week, shipping sources said.

At least two other sections of the lower Mississippi have also been closed at times, disrupting the flow of grain to U.S. Gulf Coast export terminals, where some 60% of U.S. corn, soybean and wheat exports exit the country, they said.

Shippers have been loading less cargo per barge so vessels sit higher on the water, and towing companies have reduced the number of barges per tow by nearly 40% as the low water conditions narrowed the navigable channel.

In Maine, an elevated number of gray and harbor seal deaths have been attributed to the disease, while in Florida, officials believe a bottle-nosed dolphin succumbed to the virus. It's also been detected in skunks and foxes.

After proliferating globally, a historic wave of avian flu has entered Southern California, where it is worrying farmers and bird lovers and could add to complications with supply chains and food prices.

In late August, one New Jersey park had to close its trails to hikers. There were too many dead vultures on the ground.

Abiove, a trade group representing global oilseed crushers in Brazil, confirmed the move, telling Reuters some of its members advanced scheduled maintenance stoppages that traditionally happen at the end of the year as soyoil prices dropped while soybean prices remained high, hurting margins.

    <content type="html">Vegetable/legume company HAK STOPS production for 6 weeks starting 2023. Energy prices make it infeasible to produce, says the market leader best known for the glass jars of applesauce, peas and brown beans.

"It is not only the high price, but also the uncertainty, says director Timo Hoogeboom. "Today it is two euros for a cubic meter of gas, it used to be three euros. We don't know what it will be in January or February. So to be on the safe side, we will remain closed."

If it is no longer possible to pass on the higher energy prices to consumers, the availability of products may ultimately also be compromised. "If companies have to sell below cost for months, things go wrong." He does not expect any empty shelves for HAK for the time being. "But I don't rule it out for the chain, especially in January, February and March." A temporary energy ceiling for companies could help, the HAK director thinks.

"Companies will first look at how they can absorb the costs themselves, but if that is no longer possible, they will have to scale down," confirms food economist Morren. "I expect this to happen more widely."

    <content type="html">French refinery strikes takes half of the nation‚Äôs refining capacity offline - forcing France‚Äôs largest sugar maker, Tereos, to curtail production

Diesel and petrol stations in France are running out of fuel, according to an industry union, as a refining strike takes its toll. The strike, which among others, took Total‚Äôs 240,000 bpd Gonfreville refinery offline as well as a couple of Exxon‚Äôs, was expected to conclude on Thursday‚Ä¶but Friday, reports came in that strikes were disrupting Total‚Äôs oil products refining and delivery for a fourth day ‚Äî 60% of the nation‚Äôs total refining capacity.

‚ÄúThere is no need to rush to the station (for gas),‚Äù TotalEnergies said on Friday. Despite those affirmations, France‚Äôs largest sugar maker, Tereos, said it had to curtail production somewhat at some of its factories after Total advised it that it would not be able to supply it with any more diesel until the end of the week.

France was already battling a shortage of refined products, with Russia‚Äôs exports to Europe ‚Äúfalling‚Äù in recent months.

    <content type="html">France to reap worst corn harvest in decades

French farmers are harvesting their smallest corn crop in more than three decades, following the worst drought in at least 500 years that has hit the continent.

The smaller crops in France, which is one of Europe‚Äôs agricultural heavyweights, could drive soaring food prices even higher. Fields in Germany and Romania, other key EU producers, have also suffered from drought.

(Cue the media blaming climate change and calls for zero carbon)

    <content type="html">Europe‚Äôs Natural Gas Shortage Could Trigger A Food Crisis

Governments are using every tool in their kits to curb the rising inflation rates, there‚Äôs far less they can do about the coming food shortage.

"Countries can't mandate fertilizer production because they are so worried about having enough natural gas to heat people's homes," John Harpole, a natural gas broker for the fertilizer sector told Newsweek. "They are having to choose between future food production and heat and they are going to choose heat."

The problem with an energy crisis is that it‚Äôs actually an everything crisis. In a world where virtually every industry relies on energy in some form, runaway inflation is an inevitability.

    <content type="html">France bracing for ‚Äòcatastrophic‚Äô food shortages and price hikes following drought, farmers and unions warn

After four severe heatwaves this year record high temperatures have wreaked havoc on crops and could have a devastating impact on the availability of food across the rest of Europe.

France is the leading European exporter of potatoes with more than two million tonnes of the crop being exported each year.

Food producers say nearly 1.5 million tonnes of potato crops could be lost due to the heatwave ‚Äî a drop of 20 per cent.

Geoffroy d‚ÄôEvry, a farmer in the Oise region and president of potato-growers‚Äô union UNPT, said: ‚ÄúWe have never experienced a situation like this.

‚ÄúWe were preparing to spend the winter without heating or electricity, and now we discover that there may not even be potatoes for dinner?‚Äù  [Welcome to the Great Reset ‚Äî this is why we prepared.]

The Legumes de France federation has also estimated losses of between 25 and 35 per cent of the production and yield of vegetables.

‚ÄúWe believe it to be right to ramp up deliveries to the poorest countries,‚Äù Putin said during a meeting of the Security Council on Friday.

‚ÄúIn total, by the end of this year, we will supply some 30 million tons of grain and are ready to increase this volume to 50 million tons or more, because, thank God, we have a good harvest this year,‚Äù he added.

Moscow is also ready to supply fertilizers to the poorest nations free of charge, the Russian president said. ‚ÄúOur producers ‚Äî we‚Äôre talking about potash fertilizers ‚Äì are ready to deliver them free of charge to developing nations that urgently need them,‚Äù Putin said, instructing the Russian Foreign Ministry to work on the plan.

@iceagefarmer comment: I‚Äôve mentioned so frequently that as net exporters move to protect their domestic stocks/prices, net importers are left empty handed ‚Äî like Philippines here, resorting to confiscation of foodstuffs from private hands.

Sadly, we‚Äôll see more of this in the days ahead.

    <content type="html">Sugar and Salt Shortage Worsens Philippines Food Supply Woes

A top soft-drinks maker with no sugar, a burger joint out of onions and kitchens short of salt underscore the dependence of the Philippines on food imports and illustrate some of the cost  pressures fueling inflation.

The country not only buys sugar, salt and garlic from abroad, but also imports a raft of other food commodities such as rice, wheat, corn and soybean meal, and that‚Äôs after global farm prices surged to a record this year on the back of lower world supply caused by drought, heat and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. ¬†

    <content type="html">Biden/Trump have now mutually declared each other enemies of the state, within just the last days.

The stage is now set, and an extraordinarily dangerous show is about to begin. The USA likes to do things bigger and better, and this will be no exception.  Once this kicks off there will be no stopping it, and I expect escalation of crises and conflicts worldwide.

Keep your wits about you and continue moving away from the system, towards self-sufficiency in food, energy, medicine, local markets/currencies. Radical and rapid decentralization is the only way forward.

Comms will go down at some point.  I am grateful and honored to have shared this space with you.

Godspeed and God bless.

They declined to indicate why.

They neglected to provide a timeline for when this may be available again.

Regardless of the presumably forthcoming excuse, this is effectively an act of warfare as markets (domestic AND foreign) are now blind to what is going/coming from the US.

UPDATE: they now indicate there is an issue migrating to a new reporting system that should be resolved by mid september.  Interesting date given futures contracts‚Ä¶

    <content type="html">Fire at Biggest US Midwest Refinery Threatens Fuel Supplies

An outage at the largest US Midwest refinery is raising wholesale fuel prices regionally just as the agricultural sector gears up for its busiest time of year.

BP shut two crude units at its 435,000 barrel-a-day Whiting, Indiana, refinery after a fire Wednesday, Wood Mackenzie‚Äôs Genscape said. The fire occurred in the power house and caused a loss of cooling water, which could lead to damaged equipment, according to a person familiar with operations.

*** A prolonged shutdown of the plant, which supplies gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to most of the region‚Äôs major distribution centers, could tighten fuel markets just as farmers in the nation‚Äôs breadbasket prepare for harvesting season. ***

@iceagefarmer note: just another coincidence I‚Äôm sure.  Nothing to see here‚Ä¶
