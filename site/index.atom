    <content type="html">‘Marching towards starvation’: UN warns of hell on earth if Ukraine war goes on

Unprecedented food shortages could spark riots in dozens of countries as Black Sea blockade adds to pressures, says WFP chief

Dozens of countries risk protests, riots and political violence this year as food prices surge around the world, the head of the food-aid branch of the United Nations has warned.

Director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), said the world faced “frightening” shortages that could destabilise countries that depend on wheat exports from Ukraine and Russia.

“Even before the Ukraine crisis, we were facing an unprecedented global food crisis because of Covid and fuel price increases,” said Beasley. “Then, we thought it couldn’t get any worse, but this war has been devastating.”

    <content type="html">World's Largest Cricket protein 'factory' completed in Ontario — "you really will eat ze bugs":

Aspire’s new plant will reportedly produce 9000 metric tons of crickets every year for human and pet consumption.  — about two billion insects to be distributed annually across Canada and throughout the United States.

Aspire also reports that it already has orders for the next two years.

Crickets are currently being explored as a protein-rich superfood. They contain fibre and are already found in grocery stores and restaurants, and have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional protein sources.

    <content type="html">“Shock report” reveals food prices could go up 15% over the summer, squeezing family finances further

“Some families may have to skip meals as inflation continues to rise. The report also mentioned that the UK economy is facing its “strongest period” of inflationary pressure since the 1970s, with the conflict in Ukraine worsening the impact by restricting supply chains and pushing up grain prices.”

UK: Food prices could go up by 15% over the summer, adding to the stress on families facing rising petrol and energy bills. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) said in a report that households are set to pay more for essentials including dairy, bread and meat.

It is reported these cattle died of excessive heat —  while temps were not excessively high, there was also high humidity and no wind.

Others are speculating that this is exceptional even for summer heat, and this is another blatant destructive act perpetrated on our food supply.

What do you think?

“I’ve got a tractor hooked up to my corn planter out here, no diesel fuel, and I can’t afford to get any.”

The crushing reality of record diesel fuel prices is pushing farmers to the brink and may affect food availability. &lt;- [READ IT AGAIN]

“We have reached that point to where it is very close to being a sinking ship,” Kotzmoyer, a legislative affairs specialist for the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau, testified to state lawmakers Tuesday. “We are teetering on the edge right now.

The epicenter of the next global supply chain snarl could be in South Korea as a nationwide trucker strike broadens and is hindering domestic economic activity, which may spill over to the rest of the world.

Bloomberg reports that the Cargo Truckers Solidarity Union entered its seventh day of strikes on Monday, causing $1.6 billion in disruptions for auto, petrochemical, steel, and other top industries.

    <content type="html">WTO declares 'Polycrisis', requiring global government, as no one country can solve it — a worldwide problem/reaction/solution:

“This polycrisis... is really unprecedented. And what is very central to all of this is that no one country can solve this crisis on its own. This is the time that you need the world working together. You need global solidarity,” she said.

The WTO chief drew attention to export controls, which, as she repeatedly stated, should be eased in order to avoid making an already dire situation worse. [IAF: this was precisely the script from Podesta's 2015 'Food Chain Reaction Game']

So this is the "Global problems require global solutions" narrative now for food shortages, as has also been used with "climate crisis" and covid.

Unfortunately, dozens of countries may face a physical shortage of food. Millions of people may starve if Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea continues.

Worsens global outlook for #wheat shortages

"The EU is expected to produce almost 5% less wheat this year compared with 2021. It was also forecast to produce 278.8 million metric tons of all grains in the 2022-2023 growing season, down over 4% from last year, because of the dry weather.

Production in France, which is the fifth-largest grower of wheat in the world, was also projected to decline by more than 5%. The country accounts for about 18% of European agricultural production, according to the French Ministry of Agriculture. France is also the fourth-biggest wheat exporter globally.

In addition to dry weather, the country’s agricultural land has been hit with severe storms, that damaged wheat, fruit and vineyard land.

    <content type="html">"Large supply gaps in turkey will begin Q3." Bird Flu was confirmed in "our supply chain" in March. A top US food processing company warned of an upcoming shortage of its turkey products at supermarkets following one of the worst bird flu outbreaks.

"Our Jennie-O Turkey Store team is facing an uncertain period ahead," Hormel Foods Corporation CEO Jim Snee told investors in an earnings call.

Since the USDA first detected bird flu in the US in mid-February, more than 38 million birds in 35 states have died. Out of that figure, 5 million turkeys in the US have been killed, with most deaths in Minnesota and South Dakota.

    <content type="html">German Farmers warn food prices will continue to escalate

The conflict in Ukraine and its economic fallout have had “a massive impact on German agriculture,” Joachim Rukwied, president of the German Farmers’ Association, said in an interview with the Passauer Neue Presse.

“Energy prices have doubled, the price of fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizers, has quadrupled on average, and fodder costs more,” he explained, adding that the situation was “disastrous” for pig farmers in particular.

According to Rukwied, food has been sold below value in recent years, and prices have to go up for farmers to be able to continue to farm at all. Inflation in Germany hit 7.9% in May, according to official statistics, reaching its highest level since reunification. The levels are also similar to those seen during the 1970s oil crisis.

Sudden Adult Death Syndrom (SADS) is an “umbrella term to describe unexpected deaths in young people” and an increase in these ‘mysterious’ deaths in Australia is said to have left doctors in the country baffled.

Doctors hope to roll out a new SADS registry across the country in order to monitor this sudden death phenomenon.

    <content type="html">Is US/NATO (with WEF help) pushing for a Global South famine?

Is the proxy war in Ukraine turning out to be only a lead-up to something larger, involving world famine and a foreign-exchange crisis for food- and oil-deficit countries?

Many more people are likely to die of famine and economic disruption than on the Ukrainian battlefield.

“Russia accounts for 40% of the world’s grain trade and 25 percent of the world fertilizer market (45 percent if Belarus is included). Any scenario would have included a calculation that if so large a volume of grain and fertilizer was withdrawn from the market, prices would soar, just as they have done for oil and gas.

The Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) recently said that South Africa’s agricultural sector is being hit by bottlenecks at South African ports, adding that there is a struggle to get table grapes out into international markets within 21 days – currently it takes 50 days.

“Perishable cargo like fruit is only covered by specific extensions to cover delay and this is provided by a limited number of insurers. The number of insurers who offered the extended cover are now declining this cover due to the increased delays in worldwide shipping from 2020 that is ongoing. The infrastructure troubles we are having, as well as the result of the KZN floods, is likely to add further delays, which may result in insurers no longer offering delay cover at all.”

Frosts took a severe toll on pome and stone fruit trees in northeastern Spain in late March. The production in the regions of Aragon and Catalonia suffered historic volume losses in a year in which production costs have soared due to inflation.

"We have lost 80% of our stone fruit production," said Sergio Alonso, commercial director of the Cosanse cooperative in Zaragoza. In the case of cherries, the damage has not been as severe and we have been able to save 50-60% of the production, while in that of apples and pears we will have 60-70% of the production.

The Russian leadership has agreed with Kyiv and Ankara on a scheme to release grain shipments from Odessa, which has been subject to a blockade, the pro-government Izvestia reported, citing government circles.

"In the territorial waters of the neighboring country, Turkish military forces will take over the demining and they will also escort the ships as far as neutral waters," Monday's report said.

Russian warships would then escort the vessels carrying grain to the Bosporus. https://www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/turkey-russia-agree-on-ukrainian-grain-exports-from-odessa-izvestia</content>

    <content type="html">Egypt BANS all transactions of wheat other than selling to the government.  This is the next domino to fall as the big producers ban exports — countries that need imports (like Egypt) start to take total control of what remains and ration it:

—
Egypt banned trading of wheat by third parties until the end of August, the cabinet said on Tuesday, preventing any sales other than to the government.

Egypt aims to buy the whole harvest from local farmers, as it targets 6 million tonnes of domestic wheat this year after the Ukraine war cut it off from much of the Black Sea wheat it relied on.

    <content type="html">U.S. wheat crop hit by dry winter then soggy spring, adding to global tightness

North Dakota farmer Dwight Grotberg wanted to plant more wheat this spring to capitalize on soaring prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine cut grain exports and left the world short of millions of tonnes of wheat supply.

Heavy rain has prevented Grotberg from planting as much wheat crop as he wanted and is hampering farmers across the state, the top U.S. grower of spring wheat.

    <content type="html">IRAN: Digital Food Rationing rolls out using Biometric IDs amid food riots

Iran is set to be the first country to roll out a food rationing scheme based on new biometric IDs.  Where vaccine passports failed, food passports will now be eagerly accepted by hungry people who can't afford rapidly inflating food prices.  This is the realization of a longstanding agenda by the Rockefeller/UN/WEF crowd to, as Kissinger put it, "control food, and control people."  Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

Last summer, the judge also ordered Miller to pay $250,000 for “contempt of court,” and said he will also have to pay the salaries of the USDA investigators assigned to his case, $50,000 of which was due last week as a “good faith” payment to avoid jail.

    <content type="html">Farmers left heartbroken as Queensland floods ruin crops

Shoppers warned the price of fresh fruit and vegetables will rise after latest rain event

Farmers who risked planting after the February deluge lost entire crops and face financial ruin after the second deluge.

Lockyer Valley’s mayor, Tanya Milligan, said crops were rotting in the ground and 90% of insurance claims have been rejected.

“A lot of those farmers were hoping and depending on that (insurance payout),” Milligan said.

“We will have farmers that have no intention to replant. You have people that have just lost absolutely everything and they will be wondering is it all worth it?

Soaring bread prices spark protests and shop fires in Iran

Soaring bread prices have triggered protests in Iran in which some shops were set on fire, prompting police to arrest scores of "provocateurs"

The protests were triggered by a cut in government subsidies for imported wheat that caused price hikes as high as 300 percent for a variety of flour-based staples.

Iran’s official inflation rate is around 40%, and some estimate it is over 50%. Almost half Iran’s 82 million population are now below the poverty line.

The government plans to offer digital coupons in the next couple of months for limited amounts of bread at subsidised prices. The rest will be offered at market rates. Other food items will be added later.

    <content type="html">Italy: African Swine Fever prompts culling of 2.1 million boar, export bans

The European Union on Monday told Italy to establish an infected zone for African swine fever in areas of Rome and implement special control measures to stop it spreading.

    It said Italy must "ensure that consignments of porcine animals kept in the areas listed as an infected zone... and products thereof are not authorised for movements to other Member States and to third countries".

    The government plans to cull wild boar, after several cases of swine fever were detected in Rome and with the animals becoming increasingly brazen about their encroachments into residential areas as they forage, especially in the capital.

    The Rome cases, which rose to six Friday, are the first outside the area of the original outbreak in Liguria and Piedmont.

    The authorities said two more cases were found in Liguria on Monday, taking the total for that region and Piedmont up to 119.

    The Coldiretti farm group said some 2.1 million boar needed to be culled in Italy as "a real risk to public safety". (ANSA).

Egypt has four months' worth of strategic at reserves and six months of vegetable oils, the country's prime minister said earlier in the day.

Egypt, one of the world's biggest wheat importers, is looking for alternatives to Black Sea grain exports which face disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, both major wheat exporters to Egypt.

Exports will still be allowed to countries that require wheat for food security needs and based on the requests of their governments. All other new shipments will be banned with immediate effect.

    <content type="html">FARMER SAYS PARTS AVAILABILITY REMAINS A CHALLENGE THIS SPRING

Supply chain issues continue to create logistical problems, and a Tennessee farmer says it all depends on what he needs.

David Nichols says it hasn’t been easy.  “But so far we’ve been able to keep crop protection products, the chemistry side of things, in-house,” he says.  Nichols, who farms in south Tennessee, tells Brownfield parts are a different story. “I have a neighbor who has a turbocharger issue and they can’t source one,” he says.  “It’s been a national type search for it and it’s just not there.  We’re still seeing those supply issues impact us.”

Nichols says he’s about a month behind his typical planting pace, and is hopeful he can play catchup this week.

    <content type="html">Ukraine cuts Russian gas to Europe, threatening energy supply

Kiev cites "force majeure" to halt a third of Russian transited gas flow to Europe, while Gazprom says there have been no issues that would justify the move.

Gas from this connection will not be accepted into the transit system of Ukraine starting at 7 am on Wednesday, OGTSU said. Sokhrankovka accounts for almost a third of the Russian gas that transits through Ukraine to Europe – up to 32.6 million cubic meters per day – according to the operators.

[IAF:  German energy ministers confirm their supply is as low as 2-3 weeks.  Keep an eye on Europe.]

Russian gas conglomerate Gazprom has received no confirmation of force majeure or any obstacles to continued transit of gas through a junction in Lugansk Region, the company said on Tuesday, after Ukraine’s operator OGTSU announced it would halt further deliveries starting May 11, due to the presence of “Russian occupiers.”

Gas Transit Services of Ukraine (OGTSU) declared force majeure on Tuesday, saying that it was impossible to continue the transit of gas through a connection point and compressor station located in the Lugansk area.

    <content type="html">EVACUATE THE GRAIN:

Nearly 25 million tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine, says UN food agency

Nearly 25 million tonnes of grains are stuck in Ukraine and unable to leave the country due to infrastructure challenges and blocked Black Sea ports including Mariupol, a U.N. food agency official said on Friday.

“It’s an almost grotesque situation we see at the moment in Ukraine with nearly 25 mln tonnes of grain that could be exported but that cannot leave the country simply because of lack of infrastructure, the blockade of the ports,” Josef Schmidhuber, FAO Deputy Director, Markets and Trade Division told a Geneva press briefing via Zoom.

Schmidhuber said the full silos could result in storage shortages during the next harvest in July and August.

Head of the WTO announced, “It would really help the world if we could evacuate this grain (from Ukraine),” — Earlier this week, the head of the World Trade Organization told Reuters she was “seriously worried” about spiraling food prices and seeking solutions alongside other partners.

    <content type="html">Maine lobster industry fighting shutdown for ‘endangered whale’

Like the Canadian fishers and all the other food producers that have been regulated or shutdown since 2020 - in many cases there are fights going on in the courts. But what’s more significant is that all these legal battles flow from a calculated wave of shutdowns in disparate areas and industries,  happening in concert, in a year while everyone was confused.

They shook up the nest and then threw a web over producers around the world.

    <content type="html">India has now flip-flopped and announced they are NOT limiting exports.

I wonder what conversations are going on behind the scenes to motivate an announcement in order to protect domestic food prices, and then suddenly a retraction to continue exporting for now.

    <content type="html">BREAKING: India mulls export limits on wheat.

We went from “India will step in to cover the Ukraine wheat” to new export limits in about a month.

This is huge. With other major exporters already limiting, Black Sea not shipping, US having worst wheat since ‘89, China worst on record - this really signals the “protectionist” policies (ie keep our food domestic!) will now spread everywhere. And importers are in real trouble.

    <content type="html">Food Supply Shutdown :  Deer, fish, pigs euthanized; crops not planted

An observing alien species would ask itself, "Why is humanity destroying ALL of their food sources?"  In this special Ice Age Farmer broadcast, Christian has a candid conversation about the overwhelming number of attacks on our food supply and animals.  With crops unplanted and with more food facilities burning down, the media runs stories about "food fire conspiracy theories."  And it's not just chickens -- the state is also killing deer and fish in the name of stopping diseases.  Start growing food now.

That’s two messages pushed today: (1) food processing fires are happening but still conspiracy theories (2) bill gates is largest private farmland owner but “it’s only 270,000 acres”

    <content type="html">“Central Bank Digital Currencies are Tools for Freedom”

We have literally reached the “slavery is freedom” slogan from 1984!  And note the exaples:

"Should people be encouraged to eat the foods decided best for them, such as a plant or insect-based diet? CBDCs could do the trick. Should people be limited in how much they can spend per week on carbon-intensive purchases? CBDCs could help with that too,” N.S. Lyons, author of The Upheaval Substack, wrote last week in conservative-leaning digital mag City Journal.
