The Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) recently said that South Africa’s agricultural sector is being hit by bottlenecks at South African ports, adding that there is a struggle to get table grapes out into international markets within 21 days – currently it takes 50 days. 

“Perishable cargo like fruit is only covered by specific extensions to cover delay and this is provided by a limited number of insurers. The number of insurers who offered the extended cover are now declining this cover due to the increased delays in worldwide shipping from 2020 that is ongoing. The infrastructure troubles we are having, as well as the result of the KZN floods, is likely to add further delays, which may result in insurers no longer offering delay cover at all.”

Frosts took a severe toll on pome and stone fruit trees in northeastern Spain in late March. The production in the regions of Aragon and Catalonia suffered historic volume losses in a year in which production costs have soared due to inflation.

"We have lost 80% of our stone fruit production," said Sergio Alonso, commercial director of the Cosanse cooperative in Zaragoza. In the case of cherries, the damage has not been as severe and we have been able to save 50-60% of the production, while in that of apples and pears we will have 60-70% of the production.

Iran is set to be the first country to roll out a food rationing scheme based on new biometric IDs.  Where vaccine passports failed, food passports will now be eagerly accepted by hungry people who can't afford rapidly inflating food prices.  This is the realization of a longstanding agenda by the Rockefeller/UN/WEF crowd to, as Kissinger put it, "control food, and control people."  Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

Last summer, the judge also ordered Miller to pay $250,000 for “contempt of court,” and said he will also have to pay the salaries of the USDA investigators assigned to his case, $50,000 of which was due last week as a “good faith” payment to avoid jail.

“A lot of those farmers were hoping and depending on that (insurance payout),” Milligan said.

“We will have farmers that have no intention to replant. You have people that have just lost absolutely everything and they will be wondering is it all worth it?

Soaring bread prices spark protests and shop fires in Iran

Soaring bread prices have triggered protests in Iran in which some shops were set on fire, prompting police to arrest scores of "provocateurs"

The protests were triggered by a cut in government subsidies for imported wheat that caused price hikes as high as 300 percent for a variety of flour-based staples.

Iran’s official inflation rate is around 40%, and some estimate it is over 50%. Almost half Iran’s 82 million population are now below the poverty line.

The government plans to offer digital coupons in the next couple of months for limited amounts of bread at subsidised prices. The rest will be offered at market rates. Other food items will be added later.

The European Union on Monday told Italy to establish an infected zone for African swine fever in areas of Rome and implement special control measures to stop it spreading.

    It said Italy must "ensure that consignments of porcine animals kept in the areas listed as an infected zone... and products thereof are not authorised for movements to other Member States and to third countries".

    The government plans to cull wild boar, after several cases of swine fever were detected in Rome and with the animals becoming increasingly brazen about their encroachments into residential areas as they forage, especially in the capital.

    The Rome cases, which rose to six Friday, are the first outside the area of the original outbreak in Liguria and Piedmont.

    The authorities said two more cases were found in Liguria on Monday, taking the total for that region and Piedmont up to 119.

    The Coldiretti farm group said some 2.1 million boar needed to be culled in Italy as "a real risk to public safety". (ANSA).

India Bans Wheat Exports in Growing Wave of Food Protectionism

India prohibited wheat exports that the world was counting on to alleviate supply constraints sparked by the war in Ukraine, saying that the nation’s food security is under threat. 
Exports will still be allowed to countries that require wheat for food security needs and based on the requests of their governments. All other new shipments will be banned with immediate effect.

Supply chain issues continue to create logistical problems, and a Tennessee farmer says it all depends on what he needs.

David Nichols says it hasn’t been easy.  “But so far we’ve been able to keep crop protection products, the chemistry side of things, in-house,” he says.  Nichols, who farms in south Tennessee, tells Brownfield parts are a different story. “I have a neighbor who has a turbocharger issue and they can’t source one,” he says.  “It’s been a national type search for it and it’s just not there.  We’re still seeing those supply issues impact us.”

Nichols says he’s about a month behind his typical planting pace, and is hopeful he can play catchup this week.

Kiev cites "force majeure" to halt a third of Russian transited gas flow to Europe, while Gazprom says there have been no issues that would justify the move.

Gas from this connection will not be accepted into the transit system of Ukraine starting at 7 am on Wednesday, OGTSU said. Sokhrankovka accounts for almost a third of the Russian gas that transits through Ukraine to Europe – up to 32.6 million cubic meters per day – according to the operators.

[IAF:  German energy ministers confirm their supply is as low as 2-3 weeks.  Keep an eye on Europe.]

Russian gas conglomerate Gazprom has received no confirmation of force majeure or any obstacles to continued transit of gas through a junction in Lugansk Region, the company said on Tuesday, after Ukraine’s operator OGTSU announced it would halt further deliveries starting May 11, due to the presence of “Russian occupiers.”

Gas Transit Services of Ukraine (OGTSU) declared force majeure on Tuesday, saying that it was impossible to continue the transit of gas through a connection point and compressor station located in the Lugansk area.

Nearly 25 million tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine, says UN food agency

Nearly 25 million tonnes of grains are stuck in Ukraine and unable to leave the country due to infrastructure challenges and blocked Black Sea ports including Mariupol, a U.N. food agency official said on Friday.

“It’s an almost grotesque situation we see at the moment in Ukraine with nearly 25 mln tonnes of grain that could be exported but that cannot leave the country simply because of lack of infrastructure, the blockade of the ports,” Josef Schmidhuber, FAO Deputy Director, Markets and Trade Division told a Geneva press briefing via Zoom.

Schmidhuber said the full silos could result in storage shortages during the next harvest in July and August.

Head of the WTO announced, “It would really help the world if we could evacuate this grain (from Ukraine),” — Earlier this week, the head of the World Trade Organization told Reuters she was “seriously worried” about spiraling food prices and seeking solutions alongside other partners.

Experts say Japanese encephalitis will impact pork supply as infected piggeries experience production losses of up to 80 per cent.  There are now 30 New South Wales piggeries affected by the mosquito-borne virus and 11 people have been infected, with three deaths nationwide.

"It's also the mental health impact on the people, because there's been a lot of stillborn or abortions or abnormalities in piglets … which can be very stressful seeing … day in, day out."

The disease has no impact on the safety of consuming pork, but Dr Britton said production losses were likely to affect availability.

"I think it will affect the supply of pork, because it has impacted a number of the bigger properties as well as some of the smaller ones," she said.

As the engineered food crisis has gained traction in mainstream awareness, I started writing a pamphlet/book with the purpose of helping to shepherd people out of the grocery store and into growing food as part of an emergent, decentralized food system.

The book is a run through the most important things I've learned through years of conversations about food sovereignty, in a context of immediately standing up systems to endure (and fight) the technocratic takeover of food.  "Assume crash position!"

I wanted to share this news early, rather than be too quiet the new project.  If you are interested in the book or have any thoughts on what belongs in a "victory garden lightning course," I'd love to hear from you!  Drop a comment or email.

Warmly,
Christian

The cold temps and excessive rains have kept farmers out of the fields, delaying planting.  When considered also with fertilizer and other input shortages … a bumper crop can not be expected, to say the least.

Sadly, the increasing food prices and availability issues we see today are only a tease of what is ahead.

Iowa’s spring planting season continues to be delayed, now falling well behind recent years and the five-year average after several rounds of heavy rain and severe weather prevented many from getting into the fields over the warmer weekend.

Average 4-inch soil temperatures remain below the 50-degree target to begin planting corn in Northern Iowa, and while southern and southeast Iowa have finally warmed up, planting is only just getting underway.

Monday’s crop progress report from the USDA didn’t even put a percentage on amount of acres planted through April 24th. For comparison, in 2021, 20 percent of Iowa’s corn crop was already in the ground at this point, with 27 percent in the ground in North Central Iowa, where soil temperatures and growing degree days are well short of targets. Even more starkly, even last year’s 20 percent progress still fell a day behind the 5-year average.

Now, as the calendar is set to turn to May, more rain in the forecast could continue to frustrate farmers, even in areas where ground temperatures have finally hit acceptable levels. Showers and storms on Saturday could bring another soaking rain with widespread totals potentially at an inch or more, with even more rain and storms possible in the long term, arriving Tuesday or Wednesday next week.

RAIN CONTINUES TO DELAY PLANTING

While eighty-degree temperatures over the weekend warmed up southern Illinois soils, frequent rains are still causing planting delays.

For some farmers in the region, including Lance Panzer of Waltonville, the answer to how much planting they have done is, “None whatsoever.”

He tells Brownfield their tillage equipment and planters are hooked up and ready to roll, but “Just about the time we are ready to go, every five days it seems to rain again and that’s how it has been all spring. And every time it rains you can reset the clock another 7 days.”

He says they really need seven days without rain before soils are dry enough for planting, and looking at data from his on-farm trials, he will be concerned if they cannot get some seed in the ground by May 10th.

“After we get past the 10th of May, we are shaving yield off of both beans and corn.”

“Planting corn seeds won’t begin until May, but the cold weather might push it back if this weather continues,” said Jordan Schuler, the regional crops educator with UW Extension. Schuler’s region includes Rock and Jefferson counties in Wisconsin.

“I was told that the soil temperature is around 48 degrees, and farmers like it to be around 50 to 55 degrees,” Cain said. “The seeds won’t germinate until the soil gets warm enough.”

Dining on the likes of lab-grown meat or ground-up insects could lead to big savings in carbon emissions and water, as well as freeing up land for nature.

Scientists say pressures on the planet could fall by more than 80% with such foods, compared with the typical European diet.

They say switching meat, dairy and other animal products for alternative foods could reduce these impacts by more than 80%, while providing a more complete range of essential nutrients than a purely vegetarian or vegan diet.

Part of the issue is a global supply shortage resulting from the war in Ukraine, which has put additional strain on oils and starch. Those two ingredients are usually made of wheat—which is heavily exported by Russia and Ukraine. Both countries are halting sending resources out right now.

It is unbelievable, like the poorly constructed narratives of many false flags, such as paper passports being magically found after 9/11…

The fires become an outright mockery of those of us who are paying attention.  We are burning your food supply, and even telling you we're doing it, and you can't stop us!

“A large fire at a sausage factory is being tackled by 10 crews from both Essex and Hertfordshire. Thick plumes of smoke can be seen across the town and the fire service has warned people to stay indoors and keep windows shut.

The fire service said when crews arrived the building was 95% alight and 100% smoke-logged.

The food wars have gone hot -- and even the mainstream is noticing.  Even as the fires and explosions destroying our food supply are broadly reported, the FBI warns of cyberattacks on farming infrastructure.  As this awareness grows, one farm has stood up to NY state, refusing to comply with Bird Flu orders.  Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

Diesel shortage may hit wheat harvesting and sowing of Kharif crops as farmers are queuing up at filling stations to get oil supplies in various areas of Punjab.

Reports particularly from south Punjab districts suggest that diesel is either not available or its supplies are short at filling stations. Farmers who have harvested wheat and are waiting for its threshing are worried that if diesel supplies are not stabilised, their crop may be damaged because of high winds and possible rains in the month of May.

Farmers from various regions blame panic buying for the shortage on the rumours that the oil prices may be increased from May 1. “Some of our colleagues are trying to hoard the oil in anticipation of an increase in its prices, putting stress on the supplies,” says Fayyaz from Chishtian.

“Canada’s emission intensity for cereals in 2017 is higher than those reported for the United States, the European Union and (other regions).”  The discussion paper includes a table, using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to emphasize that Canadian cereal crops produce the highest amount of nitrous oxide emissions in the developed world.

How does this make sense as food shortages are announced?  Only if it is deliberately making things worse.  We are under attack:

“Northern Ireland will need to lose more than 1 million sheep and cattle to meet its new legally binding climate emissions targets, according to an industry-commissioned analysis.

The large-scale reduction in farm animals comes after the passing of the ​​jurisdiction’s first ever climate act, requiring the farming sector to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reduce methane emissions by almost 50% over the same period.

    Zero Carbon = Zero Animals.  Hence the WEF’s “Post Animal Econoy”

This is why the climate expert is calling on the firm to better map the products that cause the most emissions, so that consumers can make better choices and the data collected by Rabobank is more reliable.

The first European social credit system is being developed in Italy, which is controversial because of its similarities to China’s infamous social credit system. This application, already operating in Rome, gives reward points to citizens who have ‘good behavior.’ 

The so-called “Smart Citizen Wallet” system will reward people with points for things like recycling, using public transportation, managing energy well, and anything else that the state deems worthy of rewards.

Those who use the application and have what they call “virtuous behaviors” will be rewarded with gifts, such as discounts on purchases and services, cultural activities free of charge, etc., which are then redeemed for the points obtained. 

According to the local newspaper of Bologna, Corriere di Bologna, the application is voluntary. It will be launched this autumn in the northern Italian city while it is in its experimental stage in Rome.

Video report forthcoming. - @iceagefarmer

___
“The FBI is warning farmers of potential hackers targeting the ag industry.

The agency said cyber-criminals might be more likely to go after farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons.

Six grain companies were targeted last fall, and two others have already been attacked this year, authorities said.

A major disruption of grain production would impact the entire food chain, something criminals take advantage of when trying to extort growers.

I’m so glad this is catching people’s attention.  One thing to note:  it’s been going on for YEARS.  

Here is a map I’d created in 2020 when the suspicious fires at food processing plants started ticking up, and then it became impossible to keep up!  

You can click each pin to find a farm, or food distribution center, or warehouse, or grain elevator, or the port of Beirut going up in flames — and each whittles away the resilience of our food supply chain.

The 20 fires in the last 2 months here (which are not even on this map yet), while noteworthy, are just the latest acceleration!
