    <content type="html">Good piece : BIG VEGANISM is cover for corporate takeover of food production!

‚ÄúMultinationals love the phrase ‚Äúplant-based‚Äù because it is a euphemism for the messianic, cultish, modish cause they have adopted: veganism.‚Äù

Some of the alt-protein research in Food Valley is directed towards consuming insects (‚Äúentomophagy‚Äù); some is more focused on algae, fungi ‚Äî¬†or mycobacterial this, that and the other. But the big research bucks are flowing one way only, and that is to plant-based alternatives to meat.

    <content type="html">Power down? Try salt curing for a low-electricity alternative

Power cuts, rationing or sky-high energy prices? Who knows what this season will hold. Cooking without power may sound apocalyptic, but there are plenty of ways to get creative in the kitchen, all while keeping electricity use to a minimum.

One alternative is to cure food with salt.

From a chemical point of view, salt also has hygroscopic properties. When in contact with moist food, salt has the ability to absorb the water contained in the food. And it is this phenomenon that is interesting to note when it comes to cutting power use.

    <content type="html">The BASF keystone:  as goes the gas, so goes BASF, so goes Germany, so goes Europe . . .

"Everything is connected at the German chemical firm BASF‚Äôs Ludwigshafen site, a 10 sq km industrial complex so large that byproducts from making ammonia, for example, are funnelled through a 1,771-mile pipe network to produce fertiliser, disinfectant, diesel exhaust fluid, or CO2 for fizzy drinks.

The plant is a giant integrated process ‚Äî and it cannot run without a supply of natural gas.

‚ÄúOnce we can receive &lt; 50% of our maximum requirements, we would need to wind down the entire site,‚Äù says a  spokesperson.

The consequences of a BASF shutdown would be far-reaching, not just in Germany but the entire continent.

BASF-produced chemicals are used to make anything from toothpaste to vitamins, [and animal feed]. It's a top manufacturer of painkillers, and its largest customer industry is the automobile industry [‚Äî and AdBlue, which is required to run diesel engines, and keep trucking running ... ].

‚Äî‚Äî

Gabe Brown on Regenerative Solutions to Modern Problems ‚Äì Ice Age Farmer Podcast

Gabe Brown of Browns Ranch ‚Äî a pioneer of the soil-health movement and regenerative practices ‚Äî joins Christian to discuss regenerative practices and soil health as the bottom line solutions to the myriad problems we face. We discuss the Covid19 pandemic and what we can learn from it, how healthy living soil helped Brown‚Äôs Ranch weather the difficult, cold and wet 2019 season in North Dakota ‚Äî and can do the same for you! Producers from homesteaders/gardeners to larger farmer ranchers can start improving their operations immediately without huge capital investment. Gabe also describes how they have actually been getting a boost in sales due to their direct-to-market approach. And of course we describe the 6 rules for building amazing soil and growing lots of food!

Swedish 'food expert' describes the "Food Transformation" we are living through using the same language as the WEF / EAT/Lancet / UN:

"The most central thing in human life, food, is undergoing a huge transformation right now and thinking about what will be on our plates and how it got there is exciting to say the least.

..."Alternative proteins such as insects, lab-grown meat and new technologies such as producing proteins from carbon dioxide and water will be a complement on our plates in 18 years but not be the main source of protein. "

    <content type="html">More food infrastructure burning - Canadian bridge causes grains transport issues:

‚ÄúAn entire economy is relying on these little ribbons of steel through Canada'

A bridge burned down on the Canadian National Railway Co. line, about 95 kilometres to the south, severing the only rail link in or out of Grande Prairie and causing backlogs for the grain shippers who depend on that track to get their product to port.

CN said the severed line only moves a fraction of the total grain coming off fields in Western Canada. But for grain farmers and exporters, the bridge fire was another example of the fragility of the national supply lines that connect one of the world‚Äôs most important bread baskets with seaports and global markets.

    <content type="html">Force majeure declarations have begun due to barges stopped in Mississippi due to low water levels

This affects not just the grains harvest, but fertilizer applications.

A logjam of ships, tugboats and barges due to low water levels on the Mississippi River is threatening to grind trade of grains, fertilizer and other goods to a halt, Bloomberg reports. Ingram Barge Company, the largest U.S. barge operator, declared force majeure in a letter to customers due to ‚Äúnear-historic‚Äù low water conditions on the Mississippi River. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Coast Guard said there was a queue of 122 vessels at Stack Island and 15 vessels at Memphis. Due to increased groundings, the number of vessels in tow is being restricted.

    <content type="html">Unbelievable - Terrible timing to not be able to export grains/oilseeds:

U.S. barge backlog swells on parched Mississippi River

Commercial barge traffic on southern stretches of the Mississippi River was at a standstill on Tuesday as low water levels halted shipments of grain, fertilizer and other commodities on the critical waterway, shipping sources said.

The supply chain snarl comes just as harvesting of corn and soybeans, the largest U.S. cash crops, is ramping up and as tight global supplies and strong demand for food and fuel have sent inflation soaring.

Around 100 tow boats hauling some 1,600 barges were lined up for miles waiting to pass through one trouble spot near Lake Providence, Louisiana, that has been largely closed since late last week, shipping sources said.

At least two other sections of the lower Mississippi have also been closed at times, disrupting the flow of grain to U.S. Gulf Coast export terminals, where some 60% of U.S. corn, soybean and wheat exports exit the country, they said.

Shippers have been loading less cargo per barge so vessels sit higher on the water, and towing companies have reduced the number of barges per tow by nearly 40% as the low water conditions narrowed the navigable channel.

In Maine, an elevated number of gray and harbor seal deaths have been attributed to the disease, while in Florida, officials believe a bottle-nosed dolphin succumbed to the virus. It's also been detected in skunks and foxes.

After proliferating globally, a historic wave of avian flu has entered Southern California, where it is worrying farmers and bird lovers and could add to complications with supply chains and food prices.

In late August, one New Jersey park had to close its trails to hikers. There were too many dead vultures on the ground.

    <content type="html">Vegetable/legume company HAK STOPS production for 6 weeks starting 2023. Energy prices make it infeasible to produce, says the market leader best known for the glass jars of applesauce, peas and brown beans.

"It is not only the high price, but also the uncertainty, says director Timo Hoogeboom. "Today it is two euros for a cubic meter of gas, it used to be three euros. We don't know what it will be in January or February. So to be on the safe side, we will remain closed."

If it is no longer possible to pass on the higher energy prices to consumers, the availability of products may ultimately also be compromised. "If companies have to sell below cost for months, things go wrong." He does not expect any empty shelves for HAK for the time being. "But I don't rule it out for the chain, especially in January, February and March." A temporary energy ceiling for companies could help, the HAK director thinks.

"Companies will first look at how they can absorb the costs themselves, but if that is no longer possible, they will have to scale down," confirms food economist Morren. "I expect this to happen more widely."

    <content type="html">French refinery strikes takes half of the nation‚Äôs refining capacity offline - forcing France‚Äôs largest sugar maker, Tereos, to curtail production

Diesel and petrol stations in France are running out of fuel, according to an industry union, as a refining strike takes its toll. The strike, which among others, took Total‚Äôs 240,000 bpd Gonfreville refinery offline as well as a couple of Exxon‚Äôs, was expected to conclude on Thursday‚Ä¶but Friday, reports came in that strikes were disrupting Total‚Äôs oil products refining and delivery for a fourth day ‚Äî 60% of the nation‚Äôs total refining capacity.

‚ÄúThere is no need to rush to the station (for gas),‚Äù TotalEnergies said on Friday. Despite those affirmations, France‚Äôs largest sugar maker, Tereos, said it had to curtail production somewhat at some of its factories after Total advised it that it would not be able to supply it with any more diesel until the end of the week.

France was already battling a shortage of refined products, with Russia‚Äôs exports to Europe ‚Äúfalling‚Äù in recent months.

    <content type="html">France to reap worst corn harvest in decades

French farmers are harvesting their smallest corn crop in more than three decades, following the worst drought in at least 500 years that has hit the continent.

The smaller crops in France, which is one of Europe‚Äôs agricultural heavyweights, could drive soaring food prices even higher. Fields in Germany and Romania, other key EU producers, have also suffered from drought.

(Cue the media blaming climate change and calls for zero carbon)

    <content type="html">Europe‚Äôs Natural Gas Shortage Could Trigger A Food Crisis

Governments are using every tool in their kits to curb the rising inflation rates, there‚Äôs far less they can do about the coming food shortage.

"Countries can't mandate fertilizer production because they are so worried about having enough natural gas to heat people's homes," John Harpole, a natural gas broker for the fertilizer sector told Newsweek. "They are having to choose between future food production and heat and they are going to choose heat."

The problem with an energy crisis is that it‚Äôs actually an everything crisis. In a world where virtually every industry relies on energy in some form, runaway inflation is an inevitability.

    <content type="html">France bracing for ‚Äòcatastrophic‚Äô food shortages and price hikes following drought, farmers and unions warn

After four severe heatwaves this year record high temperatures have wreaked havoc on crops and could have a devastating impact on the availability of food across the rest of Europe.

France is the leading European exporter of potatoes with more than two million tonnes of the crop being exported each year.

Food producers say nearly 1.5 million tonnes of potato crops could be lost due to the heatwave ‚Äî a drop of 20 per cent.

Geoffroy d‚ÄôEvry, a farmer in the Oise region and president of potato-growers‚Äô union UNPT, said: ‚ÄúWe have never experienced a situation like this.

‚ÄúWe were preparing to spend the winter without heating or electricity, and now we discover that there may not even be potatoes for dinner?‚Äù  [Welcome to the Great Reset ‚Äî this is why we prepared.]

The Legumes de France federation has also estimated losses of between 25 and 35 per cent of the production and yield of vegetables.

_

Russia is set to ramp up grain exports, seeking to supply some 30 million tons this year, President Vladimir Putin has announced. The supplies will prioritize less well off and food-insecure nations.

‚ÄúWe believe it to be right to ramp up deliveries to the poorest countries,‚Äù Putin said during a meeting of the Security Council on Friday.

‚ÄúIn total, by the end of this year, we will supply some 30 million tons of grain and are ready to increase this volume to 50 million tons or more, because, thank God, we have a good harvest this year,‚Äù he added.

Moscow is also ready to supply fertilizers to the poorest nations free of charge, the Russian president said. ‚ÄúOur producers ‚Äî we‚Äôre talking about potash fertilizers ‚Äì are ready to deliver them free of charge to developing nations that urgently need them,‚Äù Putin said, instructing the Russian Foreign Ministry to work on the plan.

    <content type="html">Sugar and Salt Shortage Worsens Philippines Food Supply Woes

A top soft-drinks maker with no sugar, a burger joint out of onions and kitchens short of salt underscore the dependence of the Philippines on food imports and illustrate some of the cost  pressures fueling inflation.

The country not only buys sugar, salt and garlic from abroad, but also imports a raft of other food commodities such as rice, wheat, corn and soybean meal, and that‚Äôs after global farm prices surged to a record this year on the back of lower world supply caused by drought, heat and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. ¬†

The stage is now set, and an extraordinarily dangerous show is about to begin. The USA likes to do things bigger and better, and this will be no exception.  Once this kicks off there will be no stopping it, and I expect escalation of crises and conflicts worldwide.

Keep your wits about you and continue moving away from the system, towards self-sufficiency in food, energy, medicine, local markets/currencies. Radical and rapid decentralization is the only way forward.

Comms will go down at some point.  I am grateful and honored to have shared this space with you.

    <content type="html">Fire at Biggest US Midwest Refinery Threatens Fuel Supplies

An outage at the largest US Midwest refinery is raising wholesale fuel prices regionally just as the agricultural sector gears up for its busiest time of year.

BP shut two crude units at its 435,000 barrel-a-day Whiting, Indiana, refinery after a fire Wednesday, Wood Mackenzie‚Äôs Genscape said. The fire occurred in the power house and caused a loss of cooling water, which could lead to damaged equipment, according to a person familiar with operations.

*** A prolonged shutdown of the plant, which supplies gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to most of the region‚Äôs major distribution centers, could tighten fuel markets just as farmers in the nation‚Äôs breadbasket prepare for harvesting season. ***

    <content type="html">Even more concerning than 50% crop loss, is that farmers are already blowing through their winter animal feed.  Clearly this means that by mid-winter, there will be no animal feed.  Which means come late winter, unless things change somehow, there will be no livestock.

"To make matters worse, livestock farmers in the region are also now struggling, with many being forced to give animals feed meant to be kept for the winter as the amount of edible grass on the ground quite literally has dried up.

"Fodder that might otherwise be imported from Russia or Ukraine is proving hard to come by as a result of the former‚Äôs invasion the latter and the West‚Äôs resulting sanctions war with Moscow..."

    <content type="html">Germany:  50% crop loss due to drought in some regions

Up to half of the crops in parts of the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg are likely to be lost due to drought, farmers in the region have claimed, with problems to do with the prices of fuel, fertiliser, and pesticides connected to the green agenda and war in Ukraine also reportedly causing problems for those in the region

The serious lack of rainfall has led farmers to fear that the likes of maize, sugar beet, potato, and soybean crops could see losses of up to 50%.

    <content type="html">POLAND: People are sleeping in their car just to stay in line for coal to heat their homes.

We can joke, "Thanks a lot Greta" but this is a serious situation and the complete collapse of Europe.  I can't believe that people aren't more upset with EU leadership at the self-imposed, utter destruction of energy supply, food supply, economy, livelihoods.  Perhaps once more people FEEL the pain this winter, we enter Klaus Schwab's "angrier world..."

    <content type="html">India has banned wheat exports to protect domestic prices.

Here's why this is a really big deal as we enter full on #FoodWars.  Top wheat producers are being hit across the board:

#1  China.  (also #1 consumer!)
#2  India.  (and now exports are banned.)
#3  Russia (#1 exporter ‚Äî but Black Sea shipping is affected, and sanctions stop some buyers)
#4  USA (terrible season, drought)
#5  France (drought has severely impacted yields)
#6  Canada (spotty harvest so far)
#7  Germany (drought  has severely impacted yields)
#10 Ukraine

It is these nations that the rest of the world upon for their bread.  And bear in mind some major wheat exporters like Kazakhstan have banned wheat/flour exports.  Supplies are getting tight and countries are acting defensively.  No relief in sight as harvests are looking bad across Northern hemisphere and things are off to poor start in S. America.

Stock up and keep growing food!

    <content type="html">More pushback, not just from farmers but now from Saskatchewan officials:

Saskatchewan warns Trudeau‚Äôs federal Nitrogen agents could be arrested

Saskatchewan Minister Jeremy Cockrill has sent a warning to the Trudeau government that officers sent by Ottawa will be arrested if they continue to trespass on farmland to test nitrogen levels.

According to Cockrill, Trudeau‚Äôs government has been unlawfully sending federal employees onto Saskatchewan farmlands to test for nitrogen levels without the consent of landowners.

In the letter, the Minister raised multiple complaints from Saskatchewan farmers that raised ‚Äúserious concerns about Government of Canada employees, in clearly marked Government of Canada vehicles, trespassing on private lands.‚Äù The farmers reporting these trespasses made clear that these government agents did not request permission to access the land and were not in any other manner given consent to access it.

What is more concerning to some than the actual trespass are the motivations of the federal agents. According to the land owners who confronted the federal agents trespassing on their land, they were told that the purpose of them being there was to test the water in the farmers‚Äô dugouts to measure nitrate levels.

    <content type="html">The losses are catastrophic in every direction.  Italy:  extreme drought

Massimo Saronni walks across his rice field, each step a loud crunch. This field should be flooded with water, flourishing with four-foot emerald green blades and golden rice panicles. Instead, the plants have taken on a yellow-brown tinge and the soil has hardened from lack of rain. Small patches of survivors dot the field, but they only reach his ankle.

‚ÄúThese crops are seriously damaged. They haven‚Äôt had water, so they‚Äôre not going to make it,‚Äù says Saronni, who has worked as a rice farmer for over 30 years. He cultivates different rice varieties, including carnaroli, a high-starch rice prized in Italian cuisine for the creamy risotto it makes.

Northern Italy is suffering from spiking temperatures and its worst drought in more than 70 years.

Italy is the biggest producer of rice in the European Union‚Äîaccounting for over half of its total production‚Äîand importers of Italian rice will surely feel the pinch.

    <content type="html">Mass crop failures expected in England

Half of the potato crop is expected to fail as it cannot be irrigated, and even crops that are usually drought-tolerant, such as maize, have been failing.

The group was told ‚Äúirrigation options are diminishing with reservoirs being emptied fast‚Äù, and losses of 10-50% are expected for crops including carrots, onions, sugar beet, apples and hops. Milk production is also down nationally because of a lack of food for cows, and wildfires are putting large areas of farmland at risk.

Europe‚Äôs Drought May Be Continent‚Äôs Worst in at Least 500 Years

Some 64% of the EU is under a drought warning or alert, according to a new report from the European Drought Observatory. The bloc‚Äôs experts said they expect the warm and dry conditions, which are fueling wildfires and reducing crop outputs, to continue in parts of the region until November.

‚ÄúThe combination of a severe drought and heat waves has created an unprecedented stress on water levels in the entire EU,‚Äù Mariya Gabriel, the bloc‚Äôs commissioner for research, said Tuesday in a statement. ‚ÄúClimate change is undoubtedly more noticeably every year.‚Äù

Several EU crops are being hit particularly hard, with the yield forecasts for grain 16% below the 5-year average, and 15% below it for maize, according to the latest data.

The effects of climate change are becoming more evident every year.
