    <content type="html">India has banned wheat exports to protect domestic prices.

Here's why this is a really big deal as we enter full on #FoodWars.  Top wheat producers are being hit across the board:

#1  China.  (also #1 consumer!)
#2  India.  (and now exports are banned.)
#3  Russia (#1 exporter — but Black Sea shipping is affected, and sanctions stop some buyers)
#4  USA (terrible season, drought)
#5  France (drought has severely impacted yields)
#6  Canada (spotty harvest so far)
#7  Germany (drought  has severely impacted yields)
#10 Ukraine

It is these nations that the rest of the world upon for their bread.  And bear in mind some major wheat exporters like Kazakhstan have banned wheat/flour exports.  Supplies are getting tight and countries are acting defensively.  No relief in sight as harvests are looking bad across Northern hemisphere and things are off to poor start in S. America.

Stock up and keep growing food!

How short is your food chain?  As systems fail, each link in the chain becomes more vulnerable to disruption.  The closer you are to food production, the more resilient — or even anti-fragile! — your dinner.

    <content type="html">More pushback, not just from farmers but now from Saskatchewan officials:

Saskatchewan warns Trudeau’s federal Nitrogen agents could be arrested

Saskatchewan Minister Jeremy Cockrill has sent a warning to the Trudeau government that officers sent by Ottawa will be arrested if they continue to trespass on farmland to test nitrogen levels.

According to Cockrill, Trudeau’s government has been unlawfully sending federal employees onto Saskatchewan farmlands to test for nitrogen levels without the consent of landowners.

In the letter, the Minister raised multiple complaints from Saskatchewan farmers that raised “serious concerns about Government of Canada employees, in clearly marked Government of Canada vehicles, trespassing on private lands.” The farmers reporting these trespasses made clear that these government agents did not request permission to access the land and were not in any other manner given consent to access it.

What is more concerning to some than the actual trespass are the motivations of the federal agents. According to the land owners who confronted the federal agents trespassing on their land, they were told that the purpose of them being there was to test the water in the farmers’ dugouts to measure nitrate levels.

    <content type="html">The losses are catastrophic in every direction.  Italy:  extreme drought

Massimo Saronni walks across his rice field, each step a loud crunch. This field should be flooded with water, flourishing with four-foot emerald green blades and golden rice panicles. Instead, the plants have taken on a yellow-brown tinge and the soil has hardened from lack of rain. Small patches of survivors dot the field, but they only reach his ankle.

“These crops are seriously damaged. They haven’t had water, so they’re not going to make it,” says Saronni, who has worked as a rice farmer for over 30 years. He cultivates different rice varieties, including carnaroli, a high-starch rice prized in Italian cuisine for the creamy risotto it makes.

Northern Italy is suffering from spiking temperatures and its worst drought in more than 70 years.

Italy is the biggest producer of rice in the European Union—accounting for over half of its total production—and importers of Italian rice will surely feel the pinch.

    <content type="html">Mass crop failures expected in England

Half of the potato crop is expected to fail as it cannot be irrigated, and even crops that are usually drought-tolerant, such as maize, have been failing.

The group was told “irrigation options are diminishing with reservoirs being emptied fast”, and losses of 10-50% are expected for crops including carrots, onions, sugar beet, apples and hops. Milk production is also down nationally because of a lack of food for cows, and wildfires are putting large areas of farmland at risk.

Europe’s Drought May Be Continent’s Worst in at Least 500 Years

Some 64% of the EU is under a drought warning or alert, according to a new report from the European Drought Observatory. The bloc’s experts said they expect the warm and dry conditions, which are fueling wildfires and reducing crop outputs, to continue in parts of the region until November.

“The combination of a severe drought and heat waves has created an unprecedented stress on water levels in the entire EU,” Mariya Gabriel, the bloc’s commissioner for research, said Tuesday in a statement. “Climate change is undoubtedly more noticeably every year.”

Several EU crops are being hit particularly hard, with the yield forecasts for grain 16% below the 5-year average, and 15% below it for maize, according to the latest data.

The effects of climate change are becoming more evident every year.

    <content type="html">Amazing new study finds McDonald’s pancakes are healthier than fresh egg omelette.

“With healthy fats and proteins from eggs and meat, you'd be forgiven for thinking an omelette is a great breakfast choice. According to this chart, it scores a measly 26 points — while pancakes from a fast food restaurant get a whopping 50 points.

They want you eating trash and will rig the scoring system to make it happen…

    <content type="html">Your pigs are dirty and dangerous, experts announced, and could be responsible for food and mouth disease destroying the entire meat industry.  But huge corporate farms that the technocrats control are totally cool.

Why?  “Smaller producers are thought [?!] to be more likely [?!] to engage in practices such as swill feeding, that have a high chance of accidentally introducing the virus. They may be less aware of what they’re responsibilities are in terms of preventing an outbreak and also what they would need to do in an event of one.”  &lt;— This is the most flagrant, unfounded assumption!

Experts: you are too dumb to do it right, and therefore, we just need to make it illegal.

    <content type="html">Backyard hens’ eggs contain 40 times more lead on average than shop eggs, research finds

Note that it is explicitly your backyard birds that are suddenly at issue.

Newly published research found backyard hens’ eggs contain, on average, more than 40 times the lead levels of commercially produced eggs.  For your safety, we may have to make your birds illegal, (just like we’ve been salivating over)!

“These findings will come as a shock to many people who have turned to backyard food production. It has been on the rise over the past decade, spurred on recently by soaring grocery prices.  BUT, after years of living on these soils, contaminants have built up in soils. These legacy contaminants can enter our food chain via vegetables, honey bees and chickens.

[@IceAgeFarmer note:  it’s just too dangerous to let you feed your family.  if you want eggs, save up your carbon credits like everyone else.  More context in mega post above]

    <content type="html">“We’re in a place now where you can’t live anywhere on the planet, and be sure that the environment is safe.”

So says the researcher who found toxic levels of PFAS (the forever chemical) in rain water samples.  The study intimates we are already at total contamination — farms, gardens, animals raised outdoors — all are so toxic they do not meet regulatory requirements.

Remember, they are already shutting down farms in Maine and around the US for PFAS contamination (full report here).

And thus, the globalists will own ALL food production — the indoor farming, bug burgers, lab-grown eat that they’ve been investing $100bb’s — will be the only option.  As they told us, “competition is sin.”  And they are taking out traditional farming and ranching.

    <content type="html">My friends, this is the most important battle in human history. If we can't grow our own food, we depend forever on the system.   — MEGA POST —

__
“Animals are dirty and dangerous.  Rainwater is poisonous - you can't eat stuff that was grown outside!”  Traditional farming and ranching is antequated and illegal!”

Sounds ridiculous -- beyond belief!  But so does people wearing cloth masks OUTSIDE for two years.  These same people could be made to fear food overnight.

And this move is happening now:

* "Rainwater ALL over Earth has PFAS” -- new study claims “forever chemicals” are now in gardens and animals raised outdoors -- remember they are already shutting down farms for PFAS contamination (see my report here) — now extending the contamination to the entire biosphere!

 ... literally, from the researcher: "we’re in a place now where you can’t live anywhere on the planet, and be sure that the environment is safe.”  This is the design. The divorce of man from nature. Separation of us from God's creation. And it will be used to make traditional food “dangerous and poisonous."  Now we see why the investment into indoor farming, and marketing lab-grown meat as "clean meat."  THEY ARE POISONING THE REST!

* “Backyard chickens are dangerous because of lead in eggs — should be regulated -- it's explicitly the BACKYARD birds

- "Hobby farms are a risk for foot and mouth disease" -- dirty and dangerous!  It's explicitly the small HOBBY farms

- "Free Range" farming RAISES risk of pandemics -- surprise!  intensive corporate ‘factory farming’ may actually be SAFER than you being able to raise your own animals!

Not to mention we have these biolabs researching every kind of pathogen from Bird Flu to African Swine Fever to take our food supply out.

In short, they are destroying traditional food and ranching, just as they are the energy infrastructures and monetary systems.

Prof. Richard Werner just remarked (here) that as central banks currencies fail, they must move to a new digital (#CBDC) model so people don’t take back their power with local currencies.  This same play is happening with food: as toxic big Ag fails, they poison the food supply and use weather warfare — it is techno-salting the fields!

I may make separate posts with some of these links for easy sharability but it is all of these dots that form a picture that’s impossible to ignore.  This is the biggest takeover in human history.  Grow food, use cash/barter/local currency— do everything you can to de-centralize.  Our future depends on it.

Swedish fintech company Doconomy has launched a new credit card that monitors the carbon footprint of its customers - and cuts off their spending when they hit their carbon max.

It uses the Aland Index as the basis on which it calculates the carbon footprint of each product purchased.

[Ice Age Farmer note: this Aland index can be tweaked at any time by the technocrats for social engineering. Want people eating bugs? Meat has impossible Carbon score. Limited travel? Etc. Rockefeller Foundation calls this “true cost accounting”, and it affords total control through this artificially imposed scoring]

Khalil Mansour has to queue for hours every day just to buy bread for his family and some days he can’t afford any. In a country which once boasted the nickname “Switzerland of the Middle East” for its thriving banking sector before financial crisis hit in 2019, the chronic shortage of the staple of the Lebanese diet has been hard to take.

Faced with demands from international creditors for painful reforms in return for the release of new aid, the embattled government has been forced to end subsidies on most essential goods — although not so far on wheat. The price of subsidised bread has gone up, although by less than if there were no subsidy, but bakeries have started rationing the staple. A bag of flat Arabic pitta-like bread now officially sells for 13,000 Lebanese pounds (43 US cents). On the black market it costs more than 30,000. “Last week I went without bread for three days because I cannot afford to pay 30,000,” said Mansour, 48.

For Mansour and most Lebanese, buying bread means standing for hours in long queues outside bakeries and sometimes, when their turn comes, the bakeries have run out of bread.

German food banks suffer as former donors forced to become recipients

“People who used to be on the other side donating and helping us are now coming and asking for help," says Petra Lehmann, who heads the Heimatstern association. "We have lots of families now where it's impossible from one income to feed the family because it's so expensive."
This is also changing people's behaviors. "We buy more jars of cheap food," says Sertap. "It may be chicken. It could be fish, beans because they are more suitable for us."

Pensioner Katrin Obermeier has started rationing her food: "I'm using foods longer, especially past the expiration date because it is still well preserved."

[IceAgeFarmer note: this is true BUT remember that removal of date markings by end of 2022 was planned in the 2018 EU Farm to Fork agenda!! We are following the globalist food crisis scripts to a T!!]

Polio found in more wastewater samples in upstate New York’s Orange County

Wastewater samples taken from two different locations in Orange County in June and July tested positive for the virus, state officials told county leaders earlier this week.

The findings come days after the New York State Department of Health found similar evidence of community spread in sewage samples taken in neighboring Rockland despite no additional cases being reported.

State officials are urging anyone who is not vaccinated against the potentially life-threatening virus to get immunized after an unvaccinated adult in Rockland suffered paralysis and had to be hospitalized last month.

    <content type="html">Greece rolls out digital ‘wallet’ for citizens; ID and driving license now on phone

[IAF: No doubt this is the kind of 'digital transformation' described for Ukraine as well... and everywhere...]

Greece has rolled out a mobile app that will replace the need to carry a police ID or a driver’s license in physical form, allowing faster transactions through a secure system calling for digital confirmation through a QR code, among others.

In addition, “We are creating a system for banks and telecom providers starting October 1, as well as for agencies requiring the user to show an ID. A digital trace will be created instead of copies of one’s ID, turning into digital proof something that has been a burden to provide in physical form,” the minister said, referring to the police IDs required for most official transactions.

    <content type="html">The Solution To The Current Food Crisis Is Small And Local, Including Growing Food Locally.

Community currency expert Thomas Greco, author of “The End of Money,” maintains that a produce-backed currency could be issued without even creating a cryptocurrency. A group of local farmers could be organized to jointly issue farm currency as a paper or digital community currency, which could be spent into circulation to buy what the farmers needed to produce their crops. The currency would circulate in the local community and would be accepted back by the farmers in payment for the products they sell.

“So the currency has a beginning and an end, it’s created and it’s extinguished,” says Greco. “It’s created by the act of spending and it’s extinguished in the act of redemption, not in some other currency, but in goods and services that have been promised.”

IAF: Glad to see the discussion around local food systems AND new currencies outside CBs/CBDC — personally not a fan of using cryptos, so enjoyed these ideas and hope we can have those discussions]

This infrastructure has been built and is now being deployed, and we must understand that it is — in the very words of the Department of Defense — an AI weapons system.

    <content type="html">All three Canadian Prairie Provinces say NO to Trudeau’s starvation policy [fight fight fight!!!]

The Prairie Provinces are in revolt, with the Premiers of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba unanimously rejecting Trudeau’s proposed fertilizer reduction policy.

In a letter to Justin Trudeau, Manitoba Premier Heather Stefanson had this to say about the proposed policy:

“Your government’s national emissions reduction targets are being brought forward at the worst possible time. They will negatively impact producer yields, which will mean higher grocery bills and less food security for families. This cannot be another blow to the affordability of raising a family in Manitoba.

Agricultural producers in Manitoba regarding the federal policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent from nutrient use by 2030. Their major concerns are unanimous. This policy would lower their crop yields and decrease revenue. Manitoba’s competitiveness in producing and processing protein will be reduced while lowering our province’s capacity to export the agricultural commodities that other countries rely upon to process food.

    <content type="html">Global Poultry Culling Doubles to 94.2 million kills as Food Shortage Crisis Deepens

The number of poultry culled around the world has almost doubled this season as global food shortages loom and the cost of living crisis deepens.

Experts are warning that an “unprecedented” bird flu outbreak has caused a huge spike in culling since last season.

According to figures from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), more than 22 million cases have been reported in wild birds and poultry so far this season in 68 countries.

This figure is double the 11m recorded between October 2020 and September 2021, itself an all-time high.

In an effort to curb the outbreak, 94.2m farmed poultry have been killed and disposed of.

Last season, 54.4m were culled.

    <content type="html">Finland: grocery stores may close to conserve power

Grocery stores in Finland could have to take turns closing for hours at a time to reduce their energy usage this winter, the country’s grid operator told news outlet YLE on Sunday. With fuel shortages expected, Finnish households will also be told to lower their consumption.

According to the grid operator, Finland’s roughly 2,800 food stores will need to come to arrangements with each other over who will close and who will stay open if power is rationed in a particular area. This kind of agreement is especially important in rural areas to ensure that all the outlets in one town or village don’t end up shutting at the same time, YLE noted.

    <content type="html">WELL PUT: decarbonization strangling food production:

&gt;&gt; “A close friend farms over 10,000 acres of corn in the mid-west. The property is spread out over 3 counties. His operation is a "partnership farm" with John Deere. They use the larger farm operations as demonstration projects for promotion and development of new equipment. He recently received a phone call from his John Deere representative, and they want the farm to go to electric tractors and combines in 2023. He currently has 5 diesel combines that cost $900,000 each that are traded in every 3 years. Also, over 10 really BIG tractors. JD wants him to go all electric soon.

He said: "Ok, I have some questions.

- How do I charge these combines when they are 3 counties away from the shop in the middle of a cornfield, in the middle of nowhere?

- How do I run them 24 hours a day for 10 or 12 days straight when the harvest is ready, and the weather is coming in?

- How do I get a 50,000+ lb. combine that takes up the width of an entire road back to the shop 20 miles away when the battery goes dead?

There was dead silence on the other end of the phone.

When the corn is ready to harvest, it has to have the proper sugar and moisture content. If it is too wet, it has to be put in giant dryers that burn natural or propane gas, and lots of it. Harvest time is critical because if it degrades in sugar content or quality, it can drop the value of his crop by half a million dollars or more. It is analyzed at time of sale. It is standard procedure to run these machines 10 to 12 days straight, 24 hours a day at peak harvest time. When they need fuel, a tanker truck delivers it, and the machines keep going. John Deere's only answer is "we're working on it." They are being pushed by the Zero carbon agenda to force these electric machines on the American farmer.

These people are out of control. They are messing with the production of food crops that feed people and livestock... all in the name of their "green dream."
Look for the cost of your box of cornflakes to triple in the next 24 months...”

Just been through about 700+ comments from the US, Canada, Europe, UK, Sweden, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and beyond:

a) seeds are showing poor germination from a wide range of suppliers
b) those that do germinate and start to grow are doing so i) slower than usual  OR ii) are getting so far in their growth then dying (a bit like Tesco's herbs unless you transplant into fresh earth!) OR iii) are growing well but producing greenery not edible produce, so poor yields
c) suspicion is also falling on contaminated bagged compost -- many reports of issues here, some discussion around Grazon contamination
d) in addition, folks are noticing that store bought veg &amp; fruit is not lasting, plus some is rotten on opening although firm externally
e) suggestions also being made about soil alkalinity from chemtrails inhibiting growth
f) some people raising animals are getting all male babies [!?]
g) sunflowers &amp; other plants are being burnt up by the sun's rays
h) there is poor growth/yield from fruit trees
j) plentiful complaints from folks that have been growing for 25-40 years that things just aren't right with a degree of confusion as to the source
k) livestock feed prices are skyrocketing
l) many sick &amp; dead animals around this year &amp; dead birds found daily (Italy)
m)  too hot/ too dry/ no rain/ storms/ erratic weather with false forecasting
n)  absence of bees for pollination
p) cold nights inhibiting growth
q) abundance of pests &amp; bugs at levels not seen before
r)  zucchini with zero female flowers
s) blatant chemtrail spraying with some warning of "cancer in the ground for gardeners",
t) healthy hens stopping laying
u) pullets dropping dead at 6 months with no obvious cause
v) cooler spring so plants are a month behind
w) hard to get the cows/goats back in calf
x)  change in taste of store bought veg/fruit
y) salads are going straight to seed and bolting
z) overall poor germination &amp; growth - a weird growing year,

Beirut's grain silos - that were massively damaged in 2020 - have suddenly collapsed this morning, sparking a huge cloud of smoke and debris.

[as more of our food supply chain spontaneously combusts…]

Everyone remembers the shocking images from August 5th 2020 as a massive blast, caused by an estimated 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse at the port unsecured for years, killed over 200 individuals and injured more than 6000.

    <content type="html">California announces plan to charge landowners for their own water

It's not satire — it's Agenda 2030 perfect awareness of all resources and economic activity.

California has announced to landowners that they now are going to be billed for the water they take out of their own wells, on their own land.  Hundreds of dollars in fees are looming, with 25% penalties for those who don't pay on time:

"Landowners whose property is within an unmanaged area and contains an operating ground water extraction well must report the volume of groundwater extracted from the well. The groundwater extraction volume must be reported as a monthly total. In addition to pumping volumes, reports must include the location of the well and the place and purpose of use of the groundwater. Groundwater extraction reports are not due to the state water board until February 1, 2023. However, if you are required to report, the report must include pumping volumes for each month between the date of receipt of this letter and September 30, 2022."

_____

U.S. cattle producers are sending higher numbers of breeding stock to the sale barn, and some are liquidating their herds entirely, signaling a trend that analysts say will likely push already-elevated beef prices even higher in the not-too-distant future.
The latest cattle report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows the market has contracted to levels not seen in years, with total inventory dropping 2% to 98.8 million head since July 2021.

UN, World Economic Forum Behind Global ‘War on Farmers’: Experts

‘Agenda 2030' development goals at root of sustainability policies that could lead to food shortages

The escalating regulatory attack on agricultural producers from Holland and the United States to Sri Lanka and beyond is closely tied to UN Agenda 2030” Sustainable Development Goals and the U.N.’s partners at the World Economic Forum (WEF), numerous experts told The Epoch Times.
Indeed, several of the U.N.’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are directly implicated in policies that are squeezing farmers, ranchers, and food supplies around the world.

BASF CEO warned farmers would face soaring fertiliser costs next year.

Exclusive: Thousands of U.S. cattle buried, dumped at Kansas landfill

Top U.S. cattle feeding companies sent 1,000-pound carcasses to a Kansas landfill, where they were flattened by loader machines and mixed with trash, after a June heatwave killed thousands of cows, documents seen by Reuters show.

Other cattle were buried in unlined graves, a feeding company said.

Neither is a typical method for disposing of bodies. But so many cows died in the unusual heat and humidity that facilities that normally convert carcasses into pet food and fertilizer products were overwhelmed, prompting the state government and cattle feeders to take emergency measures.

    <content type="html">Rail delays / problems are mounting (even though the strike was delayed) — it is a problem for this grain to not be moving.  Contributing to animal feed shortages and the degradation of the entire food supply chain:
__
Rail service delays in the past three months climbed a staggering 231% compared to a year ago, according to a new American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) analysis.
There were 204,000 unfilled grain car orders in the second quarter of 2022, compared to 62,000 last year, AFBF economist Daniel Munch said.

“Conditions have not im­proved for shippers since our first quarter analysis,” said Munch, noting that the number of unfilled orders climbed 49% since the first...

    <content type="html">tl;dr: European Commission predicts yield of wheat/barley/corn will be down 2.5% YoY due to drought, "experts" rush to blame climate change:

__
Europe is staring into one of its driest summers in living memory.

The drought has already crimped production of hydroelectric power and food, adding to market pressure from the war in Ukraine. Many city authorities have asked residents to cut back their use of drinking water.

With global food flows already squeezed, the drought has Europe’s farmers spooked. [IAF: perhaps not the word I would use for it.] Hungary's agriculture ministry said Wednesday that as of the beginning of the month it had received 8,413 drought damage notifications covering 322,000 hectares in 2022, three times the area of any previous first half of the year.

    <content type="html">PANAMA CITY (AP) — Three weeks of continuous demonstrations and road blockades to protest high fuel and food costs in Panama have begun to cause shortages of some food products, fuel and medicine.

The closures, including of the Pan-American Highway, have forced the national electric company to ration electricity in Darien province, which borders Colombia. Tankers carrying gas to run the power generation plant cannot arrive. Some 7,000 families have been affected by the reduction of electricity to 11 hours daily.

In Panama’s main wholesale market that supplies both supermarkets and individual consumers, there was little foot traffic Wednesday. Display tables usually stacked high with produce had far less on offer. Some vegetables like lettuce and tomatos, in particular, were in short supply.

    <content type="html">It may seem as though all is in disarray and things are simply spiraling out of control.  But I must caution you that underneath that techno-fog of war, a machine continues to operate with great precision and efficiency.

That machine actively works to take land from farmers to construct massive “carbon pipelines” to carry CO2 and inject it deep into the earth to “store it safely out of the atmosphere.”

The machine is taking prime farmland to construct massive solar farms — in the heart of our corn belt in Indiana, Iowa , and Illinois just to pick three examples:

“This will be the last year that Norm Welker and his family harvests corn. But Welker will still be a farmer — he’s going to farm the sun.

“Welker is not alone: He is one of dozens of neighbors who are leasing their land for what will be the largest solar farm in the United States. At 13,000 acres [of prime crop land] it is aptly named the Mammoth Solar project and is a partnership between state of Indiana &amp; Israeli-based Doral Renewables LLC!!!!

These are just a few waves visible across a vast ocean of green agenda shutdowns, regulations, and takeover of farming and ranching.

&gt;&gt; Grow food. Raise animals. Support local farmers — cultivate local food systems! &lt;&lt;

    <content type="html">Russia Sends Combine Harvesters to Occupied Regions of Ukraine

Russia has sent combine harvesters from Crimea to two Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine to cover a shortage of equipment needed to bring in the crop, a representative of a Russian-installed local administration said.

The official said the harvesters were needed because "the equipment that was there before had either been dismantled or taken away by the previous owners outside the regions", he said. [IAF: By those who are consistently working to destroy global food production]

Evgeny Balitsky, head of the occupation administration in Zaporizhzhia, said on social media that these combine harvesters were provided by Russia's agriculture ministry.

    <content type="html">Colder temps in Russia cause protein content in wheat to drop - even though the harvest is large, the prices of high-quality wheat are still rising:

__
Poor weather over parts of Russia's main producing regions is likely to mean that the supply of higher protein wheat will remain in relatively tight supply - supporting an increased price gap between quality milling wheats and lower quality grades, trade sources have told Agricensus.

Russia is on course to deliver its biggest ever wheat crop, but higher yields and rains over some of the main Russian producing regions mean the crop currently being harvested is showing more 11.5% or feed grades were harvested so far compared to last year.

The price gap between the 12.5%, 11.5%, and feed wheat grades have been increasing over the last week with a gap of almost $16-17/mt seen between 11.5% and 12.5% grades in coaster-sized CIF Marmara trades last week, but offers on a deep sea port basis have also widened to show the same $17/mt differential.
