    <content type="html">Obligatory flashback to Putin mocking Europe — "No gas, no coal ... what are you going to do, burn firewood?  You import firewood too!"

The words seem prescient as Hungary just banned exports of firewood, and the EU is panicking.

    <content type="html">Italian onion harvest starts with lower yield due to drought

The onion harvest in the southern Italian province of Bari is underway and it appears that yields are already declining. "We are now in the middle of the harvest and we are trying to move up a gear to get ahead of any weather change. We needed rain in April and May, not now," said Vito Abrusci, director of the growers' association La Vera Cipolla Rossa di Acquaviva delle Fonti.

    <content type="html">“What happens after they burn down the farms?"

ANSWER:

EU’s Plan to Replace Farms – CITIES2030 – Digital Twin of Food Supply (nov 2021)

As our food supply is systematically dismantled, the EU is funding a project to create “Urban Food Systems” and a blockchain-based “digital twin” platform to track indoor farming and synthetic meat from laboratory to plate to sewers. Is this an organic response to a crisis, or a nefarious plan, generations in the making, being realized before our eyes? Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

    <content type="html">Ghana:  food shortages hit schools as students drink porridge without bread and sugar

There appears to be a serious food shortage in Senior High Schools in the country. This is a result of the poor food supply situation in the schools which is reported to have reached dire and deteriorated levels.

He said the students are given porridge without milk, sugar, and bread adding that "Dear parents, these are our boys, and as a parents association, we have less than GH¢1,000 in our coffers. What can this do?"

The Headmaster of St Augustine's, Henry Arthur-Gyan, also said the school had no option but to manage the situation.  "We know there are challenges and so we manage with what we are provided. There is not much we can do about it," he stated.

[ @iceagefarmer note:  expect media to play up school food shortages as a key concept in the Rockefeller ‘Reset the Table’ agenda is to use schools as “nutritional hubs” for communities ]

    <content type="html">Cattle producers struggling with high cost of feed

“Most beef producers in this area have their cattle out on grass now, so they don’t have to buy hay or grain. But it’s going to be a problem in the fall; it’s difficult to make a profit in this business when you have to pay $8 or $9 for a bushel of grain to help these cattle through the cold winters,” Balicki said. “And, you do have to give cattle grain in this part of the world, because they need the energy to keep warm. So that’s a huge concern.”

Dairy farmers are warning that a chronic shortage of workers is hitting milk production and further fuelling food price inflation, and are calling for urgent action to stop the situation getting worse.

Eight in 10 farm owners looking for workers said they had received very few or zero applications from people with the right experience or qualifications, in response to a survey by Arla Foods, the UK’s largest dairy co-operative.

    <content type="html">European energy crisis has boiled over — things on the continent are about to change, rapidly and more absolutely than most can imagine:

- Germany: is restricting when and how energy companies can declare force majeure;

- France: has just nationalized the nation’s largest energy company, EDF;

- UK: announced they, too, would simply cut off natgas to the EU when supply is short;

- The EU has decided that nuclear and natural gas energy are “green” after all, a semantic change which only marginally lengthens the runway for their ‘decarbonization transition’

These are major moves that signal the hard landing ahead — brace for impact, my friends.

    <content type="html">AWFUL:  animal feed shortages reported in the USA as deliveries remain scarce:

”The point has been reached when millions of chickens will be killed and other livestock will suffer because of UP’s [IAF: that is WEF partner Union Pacific] service failures,” Foster Farms wrote in its request to the Surface Transportation Board this week.

Rail bottlenecks in the U.S. are not improving, and in some cases, growing more severe. Feed users in California and the Southwest are having issues sourcing grain, with some reporting they are paying $3 over the CBOT price to secure grain by truck. Not only are feed users on the brink of running out of grain, but there are also concerns the rail issues could grow worse during harvest this fall.

[ plenty of ideas on how to grow your own animal feed in @iaf_birds ! ]

This explosion of cardiac issues? It’s because people started gardening during the pandemic.

Urgent warning to gardeners as soil ‘increases risk of killer heart disease’

Medics found that pollutants in the soil could have a 'detrimental effect on the cardiovascular system'.  “Contaminated soil could lead to increasing oxidative stress in the blood vessels, which in turn leads to heart disease.”

Dirty soil can get into the blood stream, through inhalation.

Power grid “Load shedding” drops certain zones deemed non-critical — but this is causing farmers to lose their animals!

Deidre Carter, CEO of Agri Limpopo, said one of the organisation’s members had reported losing about 2 000 broiler chickens in a single day due to Eskom’s unilateral load-reduction strategy, while another had decided to leave the poultry industry altogether.

“Load reduction is a lot worse than [rolling blackouts], because one never knows when or how long the power will be out,” she told Farmer’s Weekly.

The zero-carbon agenda is cold and miserable.

A housing cooperative near Dresden had announced that it would only provide hot water at certain times. The reason: the high gas prices. Federal Building Minister Geywitz criticized that this was "illegal".The announcement by a Saxon housing cooperative to restrict the hot water supply has met with massive criticism in politics. Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) told the newspapers of the Funke media group: "Simply turning off the hot water temporarily is illegal."

    <content type="html">CO2 shortage threatens New Zealand chicken supplies

Plans are in progress to reduce production of some chicken products, according to the country’s leading poultry meat producer.

Tegel is warning that it may not be able to produce some chicken products because of a shortage of carbon dioxide gas in New Zealand that is also threatening brewers and fizzy drinks makers.

The Food and Grocery Council said the availability of cheese, preserved meats, sparkling wine and ready-to-eat meals could also suffer, with price rises possible.

The Brewers Association and the Beverage Council separately voiced concerns about the gas shortage on Saturday.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is used widely in the food industry – including in packaging to preserve the shelf life of chicken – and to add fizz to drinks, as well as in other industries such as healthcare.

Businesses used to get much of their CO2 supply from the Marsden Point oil refinery, which produced CO2 as a by-product of its refining operation until that was replaced in favor of importing energy.

This is major news on its own, but also needs to be considered from Europe's perspective:

- 6% of EU oil &amp; gas imports are from Libya and were just taken off the table.
- 34% of EU oil and 55% of gas comes from Russia, which is being throttled
- Freeport terminal in TX was blown up and cannot send LNG
- UK just announced they'd stop gas exports to EU if there were shortages
- EU and UK are both frantically burning gas just to generate electricity now, instead of storing for the winter ahead!

- Greenhouses, food plants and facilities are ALREADY SHUT DOWN due to the cost of energy — and somehow things keep blowing up!  This is an absolute CONTROLLED DEMOLITION.

Europe is being strangled !!

People with COVID-19 can infect and sicken cats and dogs by cuddling them, says study

The study said that while it was already known that animals including cats, dogs, ferrets and hamsters seem to be susceptible to COVID-19, transmission may be happening more often than previously thought.

"These data indicate relatively common transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to animals and that certain human-animal contacts — example, kissing the pet, pet sleeping on the bed — appear to increase the risk," said the study.

Transmission from humans to animals can be minimized by owners keeping their distance, wearing a mask and taking other precautions, just as they would to prevent infecting a person, he said.

    <content type="html">Ukraine: gain exports plummet 44% year over year:

Ukraine exported 1.11 million tonnes of grain in the first 22 days of June, down 44% from the same period in 2021, Reuters reported, citing agriculture ministry data released June 27.

The volumes included 978,000 tonnes of corn, 104,000 tonnes of wheat and 24,000 tonnes of barley, the data showed. Ukraine exported up to 6 million tonnes of grain a month before Russia launched an invasion on Feb. 24.

Ukraine is among the world’s largest exporters of wheat and corn. Exporters are struggling to get what’s left in storage out of the country, because Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea, like the key city of Odessa, are under blockade by Russia.

    <content type="html">BOOM ! Suddenly it's YOUR backyard chickens that are causing pandemics, not industrial agriculture.  This was the plan all along to take total control over food production!

 &gt; "If we can’t dramatically cut meat consumption then intensive ‘factory farming’ may be comparatively less risky" because “non-intensive” or “low-yield” farms [IAF: ie. anyone producing their own food other than large industrial technocrat owned operations] pose a serious risk to human health as they need far more land to produce the same amount of food [this is also a lie!].

"This, it is argued, increases the chances of “spillover” of dangerous viruses between animals and humans because it drives habitat loss, which displaces disease-carrying wild animals such as bats and rodents and brings them into closer contact with farmed animals and humans."

... and this builds on that weird Fauci paper blaming all pandemics on humans interacting with nature — the goal is to divorce man from God's creation. #transhumanism

    <content type="html">“Unprecedented” Summer Snow Hits Afghanistan; Similarly In India And Pakistan, Rare Mid-June Freeze Delivers Heavy Snowfall; + Unusual Cold Sweeps Namibia

Unprecedented and heavy snowfall has struck central Afghanistan which, at this time of the year, poses a threat to young livestock and tender crops.

Residents in various towns and villages of Bamyan province have reported snow down to an unusually low elevation, even as the calendar reads summer — unprecedented in at least the last 20 years.

    <content type="html">AUS: Fruit and vegetable costs to skyrocket in coming weeks

Aussies are being warned the price of all fruit and vegetables will spike in coming weeks as farmers face labor shortages and growing production costs.

Tyson Cattle, from the national industry representative AusVeg, told Today the issues were critical and "impacting grower confidence to plant more crops".

"They're unable to access the pickers and packers needed to actually get crops off the ground and onto supermarket shelves," Tyson told Today.

    <content type="html">Dutch farmers protest government's decision to cut chicken flocks by 30% for "nitrogen savings"

The War on Meat continues...

The Netherlands, the world's second-largest agricultural exporter, is one of the top greenhouse gas emitters in Europe -- especially of nitrogen -- with much of this blamed on cattle-produced manure and fertiliser.

Farmers say they are targeted while big business and industry slide, with many vowing to resist any plans to scale down or close farms.

"It's not normal, what's being done to the farmers," 74-year old protester Jan Poorter told AFP. ""You can't just close farms that are hundreds of years old. You just can't!"

Too bad people can’t simply eat half as much…

“On Monday, David Beasley, director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), released a statement detailing "the heartbreaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival."
"As global hunger soars way beyond the resources available to feed all the families who desperately need WFP's help, we are being forced to make the heartbreaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival," Beasley said.

    <content type="html">Iranian schools, hospitals facing food shortages as prices skyrocket

Local media in Iran say public institutions such as hospital, prisons, and child-care centers are facing possible food shortages due to skyrocketing prices.

The Tehran-based Etemad newspaper reported on June 15 that the impending “problem” could hit in “the coming weeks” and that “food supplies will be disrupted not only in hospitals but also in other government facilities such as barracks, prisons, nursing homes, and even student dormitories.”

Etemad quoted the head of a private hospital as saying that a sharp rise in food prices has affected the quality of hospital food to such an extent that freshly made items are likely to be eliminated in public and private hospitals, with packaged foods being used instead.

The head of the hospital, who asked not to be identified, added: “In the coming weeks, it will be impossible for many public or private medical centers to provide hot meals, especially protein-rich foods, to hospitalized patients because this increase in food prices was not seen in any hospital budget.”

Unprecedented food shortages could spark riots in dozens of countries as Black Sea blockade adds to pressures, says WFP chief

Dozens of countries risk protests, riots and political violence this year as food prices surge around the world, the head of the food-aid branch of the United Nations has warned.

Director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), said the world faced “frightening” shortages that could destabilise countries that depend on wheat exports from Ukraine and Russia.

“Even before the Ukraine crisis, we were facing an unprecedented global food crisis because of Covid and fuel price increases,” said Beasley. “Then, we thought it couldn’t get any worse, but this war has been devastating.”

“Some families may have to skip meals as inflation continues to rise. The report also mentioned that the UK economy is facing its “strongest period” of inflationary pressure since the 1970s, with the conflict in Ukraine worsening the impact by restricting supply chains and pushing up grain prices.”

UK: Food prices could go up by 15% over the summer, adding to the stress on families facing rising petrol and energy bills. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) said in a report that households are set to pay more for essentials including dairy, bread and meat.

    <content type="html">Trucker Strike In South Korea Sparks Economic Turmoil, Risks Global Spillover

The epicenter of the next global supply chain snarl could be in South Korea as a nationwide trucker strike broadens and is hindering domestic economic activity, which may spill over to the rest of the world.

Bloomberg reports that the Cargo Truckers Solidarity Union entered its seventh day of strikes on Monday, causing $1.6 billion in disruptions for auto, petrochemical, steel, and other top industries.

    <content type="html">WTO declares 'Polycrisis', requiring global government, as no one country can solve it — a worldwide problem/reaction/solution:

“This polycrisis... is really unprecedented. And what is very central to all of this is that no one country can solve this crisis on its own. This is the time that you need the world working together. You need global solidarity,” she said.

The WTO chief drew attention to export controls, which, as she repeatedly stated, should be eased in order to avoid making an already dire situation worse. [IAF: this was precisely the script from Podesta's 2015 'Food Chain Reaction Game']

So this is the "Global problems require global solutions" narrative now for food shortages, as has also been used with "climate crisis" and covid.

Unfortunately, dozens of countries may face a physical shortage of food. Millions of people may starve if Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea continues.

Worsens global outlook for #wheat shortages

"The EU is expected to produce almost 5% less wheat this year compared with 2021. It was also forecast to produce 278.8 million metric tons of all grains in the 2022-2023 growing season, down over 4% from last year, because of the dry weather.

Production in France, which is the fifth-largest grower of wheat in the world, was also projected to decline by more than 5%. The country accounts for about 18% of European agricultural production, according to the French Ministry of Agriculture. France is also the fourth-biggest wheat exporter globally.

In addition to dry weather, the country’s agricultural land has been hit with severe storms, that damaged wheat, fruit and vineyard land.

"Our Jennie-O Turkey Store team is facing an uncertain period ahead," Hormel Foods Corporation CEO Jim Snee told investors in an earnings call.

Since the USDA first detected bird flu in the US in mid-February, more than 38 million birds in 35 states have died. Out of that figure, 5 million turkeys in the US have been killed, with most deaths in Minnesota and South Dakota.

    <content type="html">German Farmers warn food prices will continue to escalate

The conflict in Ukraine and its economic fallout have had “a massive impact on German agriculture,” Joachim Rukwied, president of the German Farmers’ Association, said in an interview with the Passauer Neue Presse.

“Energy prices have doubled, the price of fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizers, has quadrupled on average, and fodder costs more,” he explained, adding that the situation was “disastrous” for pig farmers in particular.

According to Rukwied, food has been sold below value in recent years, and prices have to go up for farmers to be able to continue to farm at all. Inflation in Germany hit 7.9% in May, according to official statistics, reaching its highest level since reunification. The levels are also similar to those seen during the 1970s oil crisis.

    <content type="html">Is US/NATO (with WEF help) pushing for a Global South famine?

Is the proxy war in Ukraine turning out to be only a lead-up to something larger, involving world famine and a foreign-exchange crisis for food- and oil-deficit countries?

Many more people are likely to die of famine and economic disruption than on the Ukrainian battlefield.

“Russia accounts for 40% of the world’s grain trade and 25 percent of the world fertilizer market (45 percent if Belarus is included). Any scenario would have included a calculation that if so large a volume of grain and fertilizer was withdrawn from the market, prices would soar, just as they have done for oil and gas.

This is what Rockefeller “Reset the Table” refers to as “true cost accounting:” technocrats can arbitrarily distort market forces to achieve their agenda:

    <content type="html">Biden calls on farmers to produce "double crop" (but does nothing to help them with the exploding operational costs), yet invokes the Defense Production Act to produce solar panels.  And again raises the ethanol requirements (burn more corn for fuel)!

This is not just climate virtue signaling - it is the state taking control of the economy and misallocating resources to green nonsense that does not solve our energy problems, while depriving funding to traditional farming and ranching that could actually produce food.

This is an engineered food crisis.

    <content type="html">South Africa:  ports unable to export food:

The Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) recently said that South Africa’s agricultural sector is being hit by bottlenecks at South African ports, adding that there is a struggle to get table grapes out into international markets within 21 days – currently it takes 50 days.

“Perishable cargo like fruit is only covered by specific extensions to cover delay and this is provided by a limited number of insurers. The number of insurers who offered the extended cover are now declining this cover due to the increased delays in worldwide shipping from 2020 that is ongoing. The infrastructure troubles we are having, as well as the result of the KZN floods, is likely to add further delays, which may result in insurers no longer offering delay cover at all.”

    <content type="html">Spain: 80% of stone fruit production lost

Frosts took a severe toll on pome and stone fruit trees in northeastern Spain in late March. The production in the regions of Aragon and Catalonia suffered historic volume losses in a year in which production costs have soared due to inflation.

"We have lost 80% of our stone fruit production," said Sergio Alonso, commercial director of the Cosanse cooperative in Zaragoza. In the case of cherries, the damage has not been as severe and we have been able to save 50-60% of the production, while in that of apples and pears we will have 60-70% of the production.

    <content type="html">The Russian government plans to allow ships carrying grain supplies to leave the port of Odessa in Ukraine, according to a report, easing a blockade that has triggered fears of widespread shortages and hunger.

The Russian leadership has agreed with Kyiv and Ankara on a scheme to release grain shipments from Odessa, which has been subject to a blockade, the pro-government Izvestia reported, citing government circles.

"In the territorial waters of the neighboring country, Turkish military forces will take over the demining and they will also escort the ships as far as neutral waters," Monday's report said.

Russian warships would then escort the vessels carrying grain to the Bosporus. https://www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/turkey-russia-agree-on-ukrainian-grain-exports-from-odessa-izvestia</content>
