									Pilgrim’s affected by cyber attack on parent company
<br />
<br />NACOGDOCHES, Texas (KTRE) - A cyber attack will affect operations at the Pilgrim’s plant in Nacogdoches, the chicken producer announced.
<br />
<br />On its Facebook page, the company posted Monday night that a weekend cyber attack is impacting IT systems.
<br />
<br />“First processing will now work on Tuesday, June 1, 2021 but start time will be 3 hours later than normal start time for first shift. Everyone else will work their normal schedule,” the post stated.
<br />
<br />Pilgrim’s, the world’s largest chicken producer, said it would provide further updates to workers at its Nacogdoches facility via text message.
<br />
<br />JBS, the majority shareholder of Pilgrim’s, announced Sunday that the attack was affecting some of its servers in North America and Australia.
<br />
<br />There’s no indication data had been compromised or misused, CNN reported.

<br />StoneX just dropped Brazil corn estimates below 90 mmt.  ~25% drop from last year.
<br />
<br />We knew Brazil&#39;s corn crop was late and not in good condition, but this is a huge drop.  
<br />
<br />Remember the safrinha tends to be exported, so this is 10mmt the rest of the world was expecting...

									JBS’s five biggest beef plants in the U.S. -- which altogether handle 22,500 cattle a day -- have halted processing following a weekend attack on the company’s computer networks, according to JBS posts on Facebook, labor unions and employees. Those outages alone have wiped out nearly a fifth of America’s production. Slaughter operations across Australia were also down, according to a trade group. One of Canada’s largest beef plants was idled for a second day.
<br />
<br />Pork and chicken facilities across the nation including one in Minnesota were also closed by the owner of Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., the second-biggest U.S. chicken producer, according to union officials and employees. At least five of the six U.S. pork facilities were cutting back on operations Tuesday, according to Facebook posts from the plants.

									There is the mainstream admission - shortages ahead:
<br />
<br />If the JBS hack isn’t solved soon it could cause very tight supplies for beef and pork and much higher costs for restaurants.  It could also cause shortages of beef and pork like we saw at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worst case scenario; restaurants could start to limit supply and we could see shortages if the producer is down for an extended period

<br />JBS Shutdown: Biggest Attack on Food in History - Shortages Expected

Christian shares updates from employees, traders, and leaders within JBS to gain insight into what has become the most significant attack on our global food supply in history -- and what is absolutely the latest scripted, contrived crisis by the cabal to further their agenda for control.

									“Even one day of disruption will significantly impact the beef market and wholesale beef prices,&#34; Steiner Consulting Group, which specializes in commodity prices, wrote in a note Tuesday.
<br />Partially, that&#39;s because of the high demand for burgers and other beef products during Memorial Day Weekend.
<br />
<br />&#34;Retailers and beef processors are coming from a long weekend and need to catch up with orders and make sure to fill the meat case. If they suddenly get a call saying that product may not deliver tomorrow or this week, it will create very significant challenges,&#34; Steiner explained.
<br />The attack could also &#34;limit pork supply availability and push up pork prices in the near term,&#34; Steiner said. The group noted that &#34;we think this is a major issue but much will depend on how long the disruption persists.&#34;

<br />The Cybersecurity 202: The Biden administration aims big on cybersecurity spending
<br />
<br />The Biden administration wants to put its money where its mouth is when it comes to protecting government computer systems from hackers. 
<br />
<br />The White House is asking Congress to commit roughly $10 billion to civilian government cybersecurity next year – a jump of nearly 14 percent. Far more than that would go to funding military cyber operations, but the exact number isn’t clear because so much military cyber work is classified. 
<br />
<br />The super-sized requests reflect a punishing past six months for the nation&#39;s cybersecurity, including major hacks from Russia and China, which stole reams of classified government information. It also reflects the government’s scrambling efforts to respond to a wave of criminal hacks, including a ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline that played havoc with gas supplies in the southeastern United States.

									New research in Japan show compound in soybeans creates all female catfish
<br />
<br />Researchers from Japan’s Kindai University’s Aquaculture Research Institute and based at the institute’s Shingu Station in Shingu, Wakayama Prefecture, used isoflavone — a compound found in soybeans similar in effect to female hormones — to create the all-female groups of catfish. The feat is a Japan first, according to the university. This development promises to increase the production efficiency of this and other species whose females are more valuable than males in aquaculture.
<br />As female catfish grow faster than males, “by making them all female, production efficiency will rise,”

									New Dutch animal law ENDS livestock -- and keeping pets! - by 2023:
<br />
<br />&#39;This new law, introduced by the Party for the Animals, provides that from 1 January 2023, animals may no longer experience pain or discomfort if they are kept in a stable, pen or cage. &#34;
<br />
<br />The law is not only about livestock - such as chickens, pigs and cows - but also about pets. &#34;You can also think of the lonely rabbit in the hutch in the backyard or the bird in the cage,&#34; says Bas Rodenburg, professor of animal welfare at Utrecht University. According to the new law, animals must be able to display natural behaviour: pens, stables and cages must be adapted accordingly.
<br />
<br />&#34;A rabbit is now often alone in a pen, while they are actually very social animals,&#34; says Rodenburg. &#34;That also applies to parakeets and other birds, which naturally have a lot of freedom of movement.&#34; It could also be the case that cats should always be given the opportunity to go outside.
<br />
<br />Rodenburg questions the feasibility: &#34;The question is whether the law can be enforced.&#34; Last April, Minister Schouten advised against the amendment of the law. Nevertheless, a majority in the House of Representatives agreed. The Senate also agreed last week: the senate dismissed it as a hammering piece.
<br />
<br />Parties in parliament are now concerned. &#34;Can we still walk dogs on a leash or should we give them the freedom to eat the neighbor&#39;s cat?&#34; asks CDA MP Derk Boswijk. VVD, CDA, SGP and BBB also fear disastrous consequences for livestock farming in the Netherlands.
<br />
<br />Minister Schouten says that her ministry is &#39;analyzing&#39; what the adopted law will mean in practice. &#34;The law is worded very openly,&#34; she says. &#34;Within you have to look at what is and what is not possible.&#34; According to Schouten, for example, it is difficult to determine exactly what the natural behavior of animals is.

									A rogue killer drone &#39;hunted down&#39; a human target without being instructed to, UN report says
<br />
<br />[IAF: Sounds great. Keep handing over the reigns to sensors IoT/IoB + automation/AI ... #ir4]
<br />
<br />A &#34;lethal&#34; weaponized drone &#34;hunted down a human target&#34; without being told to, likely for the first time, according to a UN report seen by the New Scientist.
<br />In the March 2020 incident, a Kargu-2 quadcopter autonomously attacked a person during a conflict between Libyan government forces and a breakaway military faction, led by the Libyan National Army&#39;s Khalifa Haftar, the Daily Star reported.
<br />The Turkish-built Kargu-2, a deadly attack drone designed for asymmetric warfare and anti-terrorist operations, targeted one of Haftar&#39;s soldiers while he tried to retreat, according to the paper.
<br /> 
<br />The drone, which can be directed to detonate on impact, was operating in a &#34;&#39;highly effective&#39; autonomous mode that required no human controller,&#34; the New York Post reported.
<br />
<br />&#34;The lethal autonomous weapons systems were programmed to attack targets without requiring data connectivity between the operator and the munition: in effect, a true &#39;fire, forget and find&#39; capability,&#34; the report from the UN Security Council&#39;s panel of experts on Libya said.

									Hackers allegedly breach New York transit authority systems amid wave of cyberattacks, media point finger at China
<br />
<br />The New York Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), one of the largest public transportation networks in the US, said hackers infiltrated its computer systems, but noted that the attack was thwarted before any data was compromised.
<br />The MTA confirmed the attack on Wednesday, saying the breach involved three of the agency&#39;s 18 computer systems and that it was alerted to the incident in April by the FBI and other federal agencies. In its report on the cyberattack earlier on Wednesday, the New York Times said the breach appeared to be carried out by a group of hackers “believed to be backed by the Chinese government,” citing cybersecurity firm FireEye.

<br />The historic S Santiago transaction is yet another big red flag for cargo shippers. Charter rates like this only make sense if freight rates are high enough for the charterer to turn a profit.

									Here is the drought narrative coming up again -- now being tied to food prices.  This is their big play -- blame global warming for droughts, engineer the food crisis.
<br />
<br />Global Food Costs Surge to Decade High as Drought Parches Crops
<br />
<br />(Bloomberg) -- Global food prices have extended their rally to the highest in almost a decade, heightening concerns over bulging grocery bills at a time when economies are struggling to overcome the Covid-19 crisis.
<br />
<br />A United Nations gauge of world food costs climbed for a 12th straight month in May, its longest stretch in a decade. The relentless advance risks accelerating broader inflation, complicating central banks efforts to provide more stimulus.
<br />
<br />Drought in South America has withered crops from corn and soybeans to coffee and sugar. Record purchases by China are worsening the supply crunch in grains and boosting costs for global livestock producers. Cooking oils have soared too on demand for biofuel. The surge in food costs has revived memories of 2008 and 2011, when spikes led to riots in more than 30 nations.
<br />
<br />“We have very little room for any production shock. We have very little room for any unexpected surge in demand in any country,” Abdolreza Abbassian, senior economist at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, said by phone. “Any of those things could push prices up further than they are now, and then we could start getting worried.”
<br />
<br />The prolonged gains across the staple commodities are trickling through to store shelves, with countries from Kenya to Mexico reporting higher costs for food items. The pain could be particularly pronounced in some of the poorest import-dependent nations, which have limited purchasing power and social safety nets, at a time when they are grappling with the ongoing pandemic.

									YOU WILL OWN NOTHING

<br />California proposed paying(and OWNING!) 45% of home prices—at least for minorities.

<br />This will help home prices explode, as worked SO WELL with student loans, college prices exploded until EVERYONE needed massive loans and financial assistance. Now we can do it with homes until the gov owns everyone’s house!

<br />
<br />Note that Iowa is heart of corn production -- and a very low % of IA crop is irrigated.  
<br />
<br />And don&#39;t forget we just had a freeze 2 weeks ago that forced replanting of a decent amount of soybeans.

									Cargill enters space of “helping companies replace fossil-fuel based supply chains” with new biotech, to move towards zero carbon future:
<br />
<br />Cargill’s First-of-Its-Kind Facility in the US to Process Plant-Based Sugars, Provide Alternate to Chemicals from Fossil Sources
<br />
<br />Qore has licensed Genomatica’s BDO process technology and is using Cargill’s global feedstock supply and fermentation manufacturing expertise to initially produce and distribute an expected 65,000 metric tons per year minimally of its first bio-intermediate, QIRA. HELM will work with brand owners, original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers to incorporate QIRA into their respective products.
<br />
<br />As consumers demand more sustainable products, brands are looking for more environmentally-friendly solutions. “With consumers on the side of sustainability and renewably-sourced options for common apparel materials like nylon becoming available, the choice for brands should become easy,” predicts Christophe Schilling, Genomatica’s CEO.
<br />
<br />Cargill’s supply chain and product commercialization experience in several bioindustrial markets, combined with HELM’s experience with chemical applications, will help meet this need, says Jill Zullo, VP of biointermediates/bio industrial at Cargill. The new facility will use about 30,000 bushels of corn per day, Zullo says.

<br />Chicken producers in Mato Grosso state contracted to supply BRF Brasil Foods SA decided on Tuesday to stop fattening chicks next week for the world&#39;s largest poultry exporter unless it paid higher prices to cover rising production costs.
<br />
<br />The association of chicken producers, meeting in Lucas do Rio Verde, is seeking a price hike of 10% to 12% in chicken sold to BRF, said Pablo Artifon, director of the trade group, in a phone interview.

<br />Italy’s Tomato Harvest Threatened by Can Shortages
<br />
<br />Tomato sauce on your spaghetti may be harder to come by this year as a global shortage of steel sheets to make cans for food production risks leaving Italian tomatoes rotting in the fields.
<br />
<br />“We cannot find cans. Big multinationals are defaulting on their contracts and the price of cans has increased by more than three times,” said Natasha Linhart, chief executive officer of Atlante, which supplies Italian fine-food retailers in several markets including the U.S., U.K., India, Japan and Canada.
<br />
<br />Italy churns out about 5 million tons a of processed tomatoes a year, making it one of the world’s top producers. The delectable red fruits are harvested from July to September and need to be canned no more than 36 hours after picking. Any disruptions mean tomatoes will have to be thrown out.
<br />
<br />“We don’t know how long this shortage will last, there is no end of the tunnel in sight,” Linhart said.
<br />
<br />Demand for cans is being absorbed by China, which saw its economy recover sooner that the rest of the world. This means steel suppliers from India, like Tata Steel, but also from Italy, like Ilva, are not immediately able to deliver to their Italian customers, she said.
<br />
<br />Italy is particularly affected because it does not use cartons as much. California for example, which is the only other market to process more tomatoes than Italy at about 10 million tons a year, has a bigger focus on concentrates like tomato paste, which need different packaging.

									I had a fantastic conversation with James Corbett on his #SolutionsWatch series.
<br />
<br />Brought some fresh ideas on the solutions front (beyond growing food and the five principles of good soil husbandry! :) ). Some people just can&#39;t be reached with new data (&#34;It&#39;s easier to fool a man than to convince him he&#39;s been convinced...&#34;), so we have to go further:
<br />
<br />- Using Radical Authenticity to actively shift the overton window towards sanity and liberty, and 
<br />- How the Asch conformity experiments show that each of us can make an impactful difference to everyone around us, and in turn, everyone everywhere.
<br />
<br />When someone in the store sees you maskless, and proceeds to take off their mask -- that&#39;s it.  Mass non-compliance starts with your non-compliance.  And mass-awakenings begin with your conversations.

									NO JAB, NO PHONE:
<br />
<br />Punjab, Pakistan is preparing to CUT cell service to those who refuse the killshot -- and perhaps deny them from parks, restaurants, malls (see last line):
<br />___
<br />
<br />Punjab’s provincial government is turning to coercive measures to increase participation in its Covid-19 vaccination program, after unveiling plans to disable the SIM cards of people who decline to get jabbed.
<br />
<br />The extreme decision was made during a meeting of high-ranking civil and military officials chaired by Punjab Health Minister Yasmin Rashid.
<br />
<br />Rashid said that the policy would disable SIM cards belonging to those who fail to get  vaccinated “beyond a certain time.” 
<br />
<br />“We are doing all we can to compel people to get vaccinated… The government cannot allow individuals, who do not want to get vaccinated, to risk lives of those who are already vaccinated,” the health minister told Pakistan’s Express Tribune. She said that the provincial government would devise a timeline for the policy’s implementation once it received formal approval from the National Command and Operation Center, which coordinates Pakistan’s national response to Covid-19. 
<br />
<br />Punjab’s Primary and Secondary Health Department announced the measure on Thursday in a tweet detailing the outcome of the meeting. 
<br />
<br />“Mobile SIMS of people not getting vaccinated may be blocked,” the department wrote. 
<br />
<br />Officials later signaled that the plan was moving forward. 
<br />
<br />“[A] final decision has been taken to block the mobile SIM cards of people not getting vaccinated,” Punjab Specialized Healthcare Department spokesman Syed Hammad Raza told Dawn, a Pakistani daily. 
<br />
<br />Citing a senior health department official, the paper said that the Punjab government will seek help from the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) in order to implement the policy. 
<br />
<br />The measure is designed to counter “negative propaganda” about the jab and ensure that vaccination targets are met, Dawn reported, citing the official. The provincial government is aiming to vaccinate 40 million residents by November. 
<br />
<br />In addition to the SIM card restrictions, authorities might also ban unvaccinated people from going to parks, restaurants and malls, according to media reports.

									Food shortages, fresh produce left to rot and prices to rise amid lorry driver ‘crisis’
<br />
<br />Some goods are starting to vanish from shops because of a shortfall of as many as 65,000 HGV drivers
<br />
<br />Gaps are starting to appear on supermarket shelves because of a “desperate shortage” of lorry drivers – a problem that will likely lead stores to raise food prices.   
<br />
<br />Piles of fresh produce are going to landfill and some goods are starting to vanish from shops because of a shortfall of as many as 65,000 heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers.
<br />
<br />The “escalating crisis” stands to affect supplies of goods from fruit and vegetables to milk and cheese, the boss of a leading produce company has warned.
<br />
<br />Brexit, which prompted thousands of EU lorry drivers to leave the UK, the introduction of IR35 tax changes in April, which has driven up costs, and a lack of driver training and tests during the pandemic has led to “a desperate shortage of lorry drivers”, said Tim O’Malley, managing director of Nationwide Produce.
<br />
<br />“It’s an escalating crisis… deliveries are not going to supermarkets. Produce is prepared, packed, ready to go, and not being delivered.”
<br />
<br />“Hundreds of loads of produce a day” are being “rolled” – their delivery to stores being delayed by a day or more, Mr O’Malley added.
<br />
<br />This is shortening the produce’s shelf life or leaving food spoiled by the time it reaches its destination.

									I called this yesterday! Went shopping and noticed the way the goods on the shelves have been spread out as to appear fine. Most go about their shopping on autopilot but I notice a lot. Many, many products unavailable, some never coming back. Spoke to a store worker in Lidl and he confirmed a lot of my thoughts. All I can advise those who bother to pay attention is that if it&#39;s not produced or grown in the UK, get it now.

<br />$14 chicken wings and $40 lobster? Why food costs are forcing South Florida restaurants to hike menu prices
<br />
<br />For Bobby Stern, owner of Wicked Wings in Plantation, chicken wings have lately been as tough to find as employees willing to work.
<br />
<br />When his wing joint debuted in March 2020, a 40-pound case of fresh jumbo wings cost $58.88. Now his wholesaler charges triple: $190. Even deep-fryer oil jumped in price from $18.98 per jug to $49.98 over the same period. Customers are clucking about his pricier wings, now $13.99 for a 10-piece compared to $9.99 pre-pandemic.
<br />
<br />“I keep saying food shortages and no workers are raising everything,” Stern says of his menu. “One lady last night complained about the price and said, ‘Oh, I didn’t notice any increases at Publix.’ Well, I have. I could have gone to a lesser-quality wing but our customers appreciate it.”

									Yuri Bezmenov was right all along. When they talk about &#34;domestic terrorists&#34; they&#39;re not talking about antifa and BLM communist terrorists, who burned cities down, killed lots of people, and destroyed billions of dollars in property damage. They&#39;re not talking about the Jihadist invader mass shooters they themselves imported into the country against the people&#39;s will. They&#39;re talking about you if you&#39;re white. Make no mistake, what you are seeing here is in fact a full-on communist takeover, and the beginning phases of a genocide against white American patriots. The destabilization phase of communist takeover is about to ramp up bigtime. Prepare for what is coming, America, Republican &#34;leaders&#34; are not going to help you, they&#39;ll let you be thrown into gulags because it makes them &#34;not racist&#34;.

									Fresh Covid-19 outbreaks in Asia disrupt global shipping, chip supply chain
<br />
<br />“An outbreak at one of the world’s busiest ports in southern China has led to global shipping delays, while infections at key points in the semiconductor supply chain in Taiwan and Malaysia are worsening a global chip shortage that has hindered production in the auto and technology industries.
<br />
<br />The new headaches add to inflation concerns, after China and the U.S. this week recorded their biggest annual jumps in factory-gate prices and consumer prices, respectively, in more than a decade. If such problems continue—and get worse—they could weigh on global growth.”

									&#34;Where’s the beef?&#34;  Blame brexit...
<br />
<br />Beef imports from the EU to the UK will be cut from 230,000 tonnes this year to 35,000 tonnes in 2022.
<br />
<br />Trade Secretary Liz Truss warned Brussels must realise the benefits of trade they have enjoyed with the UK up until Brexit. Following the signing of a new free trade deal with Australia, Ms Truss said Britain are giving &#34;Australia the same access the EU have to our market&#34;. She stressed how &#34;we import far more beef from the EU than we do from Australia&#34; but said the UK are working to rectify that in &#34;15 years time&#34;. But she warned how beef imports from the European Union will be slashed by from &#34;230,000 tonnes&#34; this year to &#34;35,000 tonnes&#34; next year as the Australia trade deal comes into force.

									Similar reports from Scotland:  farms being shut down in order to &#34;rewild&#34; them and plant trees.  
<br />
<br />Ironically this farmer is worried it will end up INCREASING carbon footprint, to then have to import all food:
<br />
<br />Mr Connon said: “I am receiving fresh calls every week from despairing farmers and crofters across Scotland telling me of another farm or estate destined for tree planting.
<br />
<br />“The more of Scotland’s limited productive land that shifts from farming to forestry, the more we are likely to simply offshore our emissions or even increase our carbon footprint.”

<br />CHICAGO, June 17 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are seeking increased oversight of the beef sector as concerns about anticompetitive behavior increase after the pandemic and a cyberattack on a major meat company, JBS USA.
<br />
<br />Agriculture officials are meanwhile pushing for more processing capacity and ranchers are opening new slaughterhouses after plant shutdowns highlighted the industry’s reliance on large facilities run by four main processors.

									Milk made from pineapple and cabbage — something no human would have ever dreamed of pouring into their breakfast cereal. The product, called NotMilk, uses more than a dozen ingredients, including chicory root fiber, coconut oil and pea protein, to make what the packaging calls a “plant-based milk alternative.” Featured on the carton: a drawing of a cow crossed out in black — erased.
<br />
<br />Sold at Whole Foods in the United States, NotMilk will reach nearly 3,000 U.S. grocery stores this year, in addition to being available in Chile, Argentina, Colombia and Brazil. Investors include Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, which owns Whole Foods. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) NotCo also makes plant-based mayonnaise, ice cream and burgers using the same base technology.
<br />
<br />(YES you read that right -- Bezos funds the Not Company -- AND sells their products at WholeFoods)

									India:  Peta behind campaign to take control of Indian dairy industry, says Amul MD RS Sodhi
<br />
<br />Amul MD RS Sodhi has hit out at Peta India over its letter saying that the cooperative organisation should venture into production of plant-based milk. The controversy began when Peta India and some others moved the ASCI against Amul&#39;s ad that claimed that only cattle milk is real milk. After ASCI settled the matter in favour of Amul, Peta India shot off a letter to Amul, saying that plant-based milk like soya milk and almond milk is gaining in popularity world-wide, and that Amul should join the business rather than campaign against it. Reacting to the letter Amul MD says that plant-based milk is based on vegetable oil in which chemicals are added as stabilisers and emuslifiers. The vitamins in these products are also added in form of chemicals, said RS Sodhi.

									This is Amateur Hour next to Blackrock!  But same principle:
<br />
<br />YOU VILL OWN NOTHING!
<br />
<br />___
<br />
<br />&#39;Very frightening&#39; plan by developer to buy $1B in homes will price renters out: anti-poverty group
<br />
<br />An anti-poverty group is calling a Toronto-based developer&#39;s plan to buy $1 billion worth of single-family homes and turn them into rental properties a &#34;frightening&#34; example of how even more people will be priced out of an increasingly expensive housing market. 
<br />
<br />The plan, reported by the Globe and Mail on Monday, would see Core Development Group build a single-family home rental business by buying housing stock in medium-sized cities across Ontario, including London, Kingston, Hamilton, Barrie, Cambridge, Peterborough, Guelph and St. Catharines. 
<br />
<br />The developer wants to expand its footprint outside the province by 2026, to eventually build a fleet of 4,000 rental units in Ontario, B.C., Quebec and Atlantic Canada.
<br />
<br />Critics say the move couldn&#39;t come at a worse time. Rents and housing prices are soaring across Canada, creating a shortage of single-family homes and making housing ever less affordable.
<br />
<br />&#34;I find it very frightening. It makes it even harder to find a decent place to rent, which at this point is darn-near impossible,&#34; said Samantha Lawrence, a member of the London, Ont., chapter of ACORN, a community organization of low- and moderate-income people.

									Portugal:  GOVERNMENT TO SUSPEND NEW WATER HOLES IN ALENTEJO AND ALGARVE AMIDST DROUGHT
<br />
<br />Suspend new water boreholes in the south of the country and intensify the promotion of reducing urban and agricultural water consumption. These are measures that the Government announced today, Wednesday the 20th, to combat the drought situation that the country is facing, with the most problematic regions being the Alentejo and the Algarve.
<br />
<br />&#34;Objectively drought is a structural problem&#34; in Portugal said Pedro Matos Fernandes, Minister of Environment and Energy Transition, at the end of a Interministerial Drought Commission meeting. &#34;It seems clear to all who attended the meeting that in consensus and in dialogue with all sectors we really have to change the consumption profile in Portugal,&#34; added Mr. Fernandes.
<br />
<br />And to make this change in water consumption habits, the Government say they have &#34;three main targets&#34;: &#34;the municipalities, agriculture, and tourism.&#34;

									Duckponics / Quackaponics:
<br />
<br />Duck Aquaponics is sometimes referred to as Quackaponics. In this method, instead of using fish in an aquaponics system, you will raise ducks in a pond where the pond collects the animal droppings. From there, the water, now with nutrients from the droppings, will be pumped out and filtered. This will then be used to nourish the plants in your grow beds. These grow beds with drainage are connected back to the pond. It also serves as a filtration system so that your ducks can have cleaner water once again. 
<br />
<br />But using ducks for farming is not a totally new approach. In fact, in the 6th century, Chinese agriculture already used ducks aside from fish in their early aquaponics system.

<br />A heat dome is baking Arizona and Nevada, where temperatures have soared past 115 degrees this week and doctors are warning that people can get third-degree burns from the sizzling asphalt.
<br />
<br />At Lake Mead, which supplies water for 25 million people in three southwestern states and Mexico, water levels have plunged to their lowest point since the reservoir was filled in the 1930s. In California, farmers are abandoning their thirstiest crops to save others, and communities are debating whether to ration tap water.

									“An AgTech company most people have never heard of could prove itself more disruptive than Netflix or Airbnb”
<br />
<br />The company, Indigo, uses “natural microbiology and tech to improve sustainability, profits for growers, and, of course, consumer health” with the help from “a digital platform that allows growers and buyers to electronically connect with each other.”
<br />
<br />It has launched ventures that sprawl across the supply chain and the globe. As of right now, it manufactures seed treatments, incubates dozens of precision ag technologies, brokers billions of dollars of commodities, and is investing in storage, logistics, and more. The idea is now not just to sell a profitable alternative within the existing system, but to disrupt agriculture as we know it.

									1,000,000 chickens euthanized due to labor strike in Quebec:
<br />
<br />“The Saint-Hyacinthe farmer saw 62,000 of his chickens euthanized because of the workers’ strike paralyzing the Exceldor slaughterhouse in Saint-Anselme. On Wednesday, Premier François Legault urged union members to agree to mediation to settle the dispute and stop the “indecent” waste of food.
<br />
<br />Bazinet said he suffered a “shock” when he saw his chickens dead on the floor after a team passed through to euthanize them. Since May 23, when the workers’ dispute started, one million chickens have been asphyxiated with carbon dioxide in Quebec.

<br />“At the moderate drought stage, hay prices historically begin to rise, and horse sales begin to increase. Severe drought impacts include the loss of crops and pastures, as well as water restrictions and shortages. Extreme droughts have led to widespread watering bans in the past, as well as long-term crop and pasture damage, as well as fish kills being reported in shallower bodies of water.

									UK: Food shortages now ‘inevitable’ due to labour crisis, industry warns
<br />
<br />[ IAF: grow your own food folks! ]
<br />____
<br />
<br />Worsening supermarket food shortages are now “inevitable” in the coming weeks as labour shortages across the food supply chain approach crunch point, the sector has warned.
<br />
<br />Chronic driver shortages have been compounded by shortfalls across other low-paid sectors including harvesting, manufacturing and packaging, and the supply chain is creaking under the pressure.
<br />
<br />Trade bodies, logistics firms and suppliers all warn that the continued reopening of the economy combined with the start of the summer holidays will see a tipping point in supermarkets’ ability to keep shelves fully stocked.

									Moscow hospitals to deny routine treatment to patients who refuse Covid-19 vaccines, as Kremlin warns skepticism is costing lives
<br />
<br />People waiting for planned operations and other non-urgent medical treatment in Moscow will be denied care in the Russian capital’s hospitals if they have not been vaccinated against Covid-19, but are eligible to receive a jab.
<br />
<br />The rule change, designed to protect patients, came from the city&#39;s Department of Health on Friday. Under the new measures, only those with certificates proving they have been immunized will be admitted onto wards for most types of treatment and procedures.
<br />
<br />Emergency care, along with anti-cancer therapy and support for those with blood diseases, “will be provided, without exception, to every resident of the city, regardless of their vaccination status,” the city administration confirmed.
<br />
<br />“A person who is in a hospital because of an injury or illness, by definition, has a weakened immune system. For such patients, coronavirus disease is especially dangerous,” officials said in a statement. “Every day, patients are transferred from Moscow clinics to Covid hospitals. If a week ago there were 130 such cases per day, then yesterday it was already almost 200.”

									UK: Food Shortages ‘Inevitable&#39; &amp; Beef Imports cut 85% under Brexit
<br />
<br />Industry experts are warning that food shortages are &#34;inevitable&#34; in the UK as crops rot without reaching retail. Imports of beef from the EU are to be cut 85% under Brexit, leaving Brits asking &#34;Where&#39;s the beef?&#34; and seeing absurdly high prices.  What&#39;s more -- the mainstream media is acknowledging the food shortages ahead, which means we are truly entering  the &#34;Problem/Reaction&#34; stage of the dialectic intended to herd people into accepting the &#34;Solution&#34; of the fake food from the technocrats.  The UK may be ahead of the curve here, but this is going global -- watch this video to find out why.

<br />Farm to arm: Atrium Health delivering COVID-19 vaccines straight to rural workers
<br />
<br />Atrium Health has started a new program that brings COVID-19 vaccines directly to farms across the region.  [IAF: I&#39;m sure their consent is properly informed: &#34;safe &amp; effective&#34;]
<br />
<br />Dr. Dawn Caviness, a family medicine physician with Atrium Health – Cabarrus, understands how a farmer thinks.
<br />
<br />Caviness knows working on a farm is all-consuming and said studies show many farmers don&#39;t prioritize consistent health care. That same trend shows in vaccination rates in rural areas of North Carolina.
<br />
<br />“Also with the farm workers, often these are non-English-speaking workers on a government contract, they do not drive, they live on the edge of the farm,” Caviness said.
<br />
<br />So far, Atrium Health has brought the shots directly to 10 different farms in the region, working through some hesitancy and breaking down the barriers keeping many from getting vaccinated.

									Maersk: ‘Unceasing congestion becoming a global problem’
<br />
<br />Delays of one or two days are becoming the norm at many ports as terminals become a bottleneck, according to Maersk.
<br />Gary Howard | Jun 17, 2021
<br />
<br />The container line’s analysis of disruption in the market came as it announced its strategy to cope with ongoing delays at the world’s third-busiest terminal, Yantian. Maersk and its partners will omit Yantian for 84 vessels across multiple services affecting 19 of Maersk’s mainland services, while some of its vessels will continue to call Yantian.

									The UK is pushing forward on a program for &#34;novel vaccinations&#34; for world&#39;s livestock, based on the zoonotic LIE -- with funding from the Gates Foundation:
<br />
<br />_
<br />
<br />G7 Leaders To Agree Landmark Global Health Declaration: 12 June 2021
<br />
<br />UK will establish a new centre to develop vaccines to prevent zoonotic diseases spreading from animals to humans
<br />
<br />75% of new human diseases originate in animals and these diseases are emerging at an increasing rate. Controlling zoonotic diseases is a key element of the PM&#39;s 5 Point Plan for preventing future pandemics set out at the UN last year - the first plan articulated by a G7 leader on pandemic preparedness. To stop new animal-borne diseases before they put people at risk, the UK will establish a UK Animal Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre at The Pirbright Institute in Surrey.
<br />
<br />The UK has contributed £10 million of funding for centre, which will establish the UK as world leader in the rapidly growing field of novel livestock vaccine development capability. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation will provide £14.5m to establish the centre, building on its current investments in vaccines for livestock and zoonotic diseases at The Pirbright Institute.
<br />
<br />This follows the Prime Minister&#39;s announcement last month that the UK had launched plans for a global &#39;pandemic radar&#39; to identify emerging COVID-19 variants and track new diseases around the world. Today he will ask for G7 support for the Global Pandemic Radar, which will protect domestic vaccine programmes against new vaccine-resistant variants by identifying them early and before they are able to spread.

									China is working overtime to keep the world unaware of their internal struggles. Grains analysts who speak out are DISAPPEARING.
<br />
<br />I am working on a report now, but frankly am struggling to capture the full extent of this situation -- with the water being shut off in the US, and China&#39;s crops failing, on the heels of Brazil&#39;s struggles with safrinha -- this is it.  The world is steaming full ahead into an unforgiving wall of famine.
<br />
<br />This will lead to the &#34;climate lockdowns.&#34;  This justifies the &#34;climate tracing&#34; eyes in the sky.  You will eat the bugs.  It is all so clear now -- and imminent.  
<br />
<br />Warn those you love.  And brace.

									DESTROY the hydroelectric dams!  We don&#39;t need the power generation! Nevermind that you&#39;ll be required to have an electric car by 2030.  Nevermind we&#39;re closing coal.  SHUT IT ALL DOWN.  (Because fish and stuff.)

<br />Plan to raze 4 dams on California-Oregon line clears hurdle
<br />
<br />A proposal to bring down four hydroelectric dams near the California-Oregon border cleared a major regulatory hurdle Thursday, setting the stage for the largest dam demolition project in U.S. history to save imperiled migratory salmon.
<br />
<br />The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission action comes after the demolition proposal almost fell apart last summer, but then a new agreement and additional funding revived it. Thursday’s ruling will allow the utility that runs the dams, PacifiCorp, to transfer its hydroelectric license jointly to the nonprofit Klamath River Renewal Corporation, Oregon and California.

									Municipal water supplies down to 1-2 weeks in parts of Oregon:
<br />
<br />Oregon is experiencing a shortage of chlorine, the chemical used in small amounts by water treatment facilities to prevent harmful bacteria growth in drinking water supply. State officials say they have a plan to help water districts across Oregon get the chlorine they need if their stockpiles run low and there’s no threat to the water the public depends on.
<br />
<br />But city leaders in Lake Oswego and Tigard have asked residents to reduce their water use during the shortage.
<br />
<br />The shortage occurred after a power outage earlier this month at the Westlake chemical facility in Longview, Washington, the main provider of chlorine for Oregon.
<br />
<br />Matt Marhine, the deputy director at the Oregon Department of Emergency Management, says the shortage is not unique to Oregon.
<br />
<br />“[This] is a situation that is occurring nationally as we see shortages and challenges with chlorine distribution and production throughout the country,” he said.
<br />
<br />Here in the West, the distribution and production of the chlorine used in water and treatment and wastewater treatment is mostly facilitated out of Westlake. The facility had a power disruption due to a power connection failure, which is in the process of being repaired today.
<br />
<br />“We expect to see that that facility has power before the end of the month and production is able to resume and deliveries get back on track,” Marheine said.
<br />
<br />Oregon Emergency Management is working with 33 state agencies to keep the public informed of the water status. However, Marheine wanted to make one thing clear:
<br />
<br />“The drinking water in the state of Oregon is clean and safe to use and drink,” he said.
<br />
<br />The concern is how long the current chlorine supply will last. Most Oregon water districts have around a month’s supply of chlorine, according to Andre Ourso, administrator for the Oregon Health Authorities’ Center for Health Protection.
<br />
<br />But some water districts are not in such good standing. The district that supplies water to Junction City has only a seven-day supply of chlorine.
<br />
<br />“We can look into transferring some supply if it’s possible to those systems that are in need,” Ourso said.
<br />
<br />Other cities with lower supply include Corvallis, with an 18-day supply, Estacada with 16 days, Florence with 16 days, Medford with 14 days, Ashlyn with 14 days, Forest Grove with 15 days and Scappoose with 14 days.

									Global Famine: Why? Bioengineered Tiny Humans for a Zero Carbon Future
<br />
<br />As China arrests grains analysts for speaking about their grain shortages, and the US turns off the water to its crops, the question must be asked:  why engineer a global famine?  In this special Ice Age Farmer broadcast, Christian looks at their stated goals:  a transhumanist future of bio-engineered tiny humans (with tiny carbon footprints, of course!), fed edible vaccines in fake food, unable to eat real meat.  Only by understanding how extreme is the agenda we are facing can one fully appreciate the extent of the crisis they are manufacturing to achieve that agenda -- and the urgency with which we must fight it.

									Friends, it is with great sadness that I learn that my friend Robert Felix, author of “Not by Fire, but by Ice” and “Magnetic Reversals and Evolutionary Leaps,” has passed.
<br />
<br />Robert was himself &#39;leaps&#39; ahead of most in his work on cosmic cycles, geomagnetic reversals, and correlations with terrestrial events including the onset of ice ages. His work truly set the stage both for our understanding of cosmic/Earth events and a popular appreciation thereof.  He has been a personal inspiration to me and, I know, many others.
<br />
<br />His blog remains at <a href="https://iceagenow.info" rel="noopener">iceagenow.info</a> - and he will be missed.  Thank you for your years of dedicated work, Robert.
<br />
<br />[ While Robert did receive the J&amp;J shot just weeks ago, he mentions in comments here that the health issues had begun earlier, and out of respect, I will leave it at that. ]

									Is this why Gill Bates is pushing his thousands of acres into solar?  from The Guardian (who accepts funding from Gates Foundation):
<br />
<br />___
<br />Microbes and solar power ‘could produce 10 times more food than plants’
<br />
<br />The system would also have very little impact on the environment, in contrast to livestock farming, &#34;scientists&#34; say
<br />
<br />Combining solar power and microbes could produce 10 times more protein than crops such as soya beans, according to a &#34;new study.&#34;
<br />
<br />The system would also have very little impact on the environment, the researchers said, in stark contrast to livestock farming which results in huge amounts of climate-heating gases as well as water pollution.
<br />
<br />The concept uses electricity from solar panels and carbon dioxide from the air to create fuel for microbes, which are grown in bioreactor vats and then processed into dry protein powders. The process makes highly efficient use of land, water and fertiliser and could be deployed anywhere, not just in countries with strong sunshine or fertile soils, the scientists said.
<br />
<br />Food security is a “critical issue” for humanity in coming decades, they said, with the global population growing, biofuels competing for land with crops, and about 800 million people already undernourished today. Furthermore, tackling the climate crisis will be near impossible without slashing emissions from animal and dairy food production.
<br />
<br />Microbes are already used to make many common foods, such as bread, yoghurt, beer and Quorn. But other researchers said converting consumers to eating microbial protein might be difficult and that such foods may not be nutritionally complete.
<br />
<br />Dorian Leger, at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam, Germany, who led the new analysis, said: “We think microbial foods are very promising and will be one of the major contributors to solving the potential food crisis.

									the cost of bringing a refrigerated container from Italy to New Jersey has soared to $10,000, more than twice the going rate before the pandemic.
<br />&#34;They say there&#39;s not enough containers in Europe, lack of space on the boats,&#34; says Philip Marfuggi, CEO of the Ambriola Co. and a board member of the Cheese Importers Association of America.
<br />It not only takes up to twice as long for shipments to arrive, he says, but deliveries have become less predictable.
<br />&#34;Like the other day, I had eight containers show up,&#34; Marfuggi says. &#34;They should have been like two a week. And then all of a sudden, they all showed up at once.&#34;
<br />All of this unpredictability creates costs and headaches for businesses that had grown accustomed to reliable, just-in-time delivery.

									UK Supermarkets introduce RATIONING after shortage of store cupboard staple
<br />
<br />Supermarkets are set to introduce new rationing after tinned tomato suppliers revealed they were running low on the item.
<br />
<br />After three years of poor harvests, tinned tomato suppliers have imposed limits on the amount each supermarket receives.
<br />
<br />This is to avoid running out of stock before the next harvest begins in August.
<br />
<br />Director at Conserve Italia, Diego Pariotti, said: “We are basically out of stock on every single line because for the last three years we didn’t have enough to satisfy demand.”
<br />
<br />Currently, Italy supplies more than three quarters of the UK’s tomatoes.
<br />
<br />As a consequence, Britons may not be able to get their hands on tinned tomatoes this summer.
<br />
<br />These shortages have also led to an increase of 20 percent on prices..
<br />
<br />[IAF:  Remember Italy can&#39;t find steel for cans, and so this harvest risks going to waste!

									France decides to start phasing out cows and pigs  to hit “climate targets.” Not a joke.
<br />
<br />“Post-animal economy.”
<br />
<br />#WarOnMeat 
<br />
<br />____
<br />
<br />France plans to reduce livestock numbers to meet climate targets
<br />In order to become climate neutral by 2050, livestock numbers are to be reduced in France. The government plans 25% fewer cattle and 30% fewer pigs to reduce CO2 emissions by 46%.
<br />
<br />To achieve its own climate targets, the French government is apparently planning to cut back on livestock. The National Strategy for Decarbonization (SNBC) stipulates that France - like the European Union as a whole - should become climate-neutral by 2050.
<br />
<br />In order to reduce agricultural emissions by 18% between 2015 and 2030, the Paris Ministry of Agriculture is now aiming to reduce dairy and suckler cow herds by 13% and 12%, respectively, and sow numbers by 14%. Over the 2050 time horizon, the cattle herd and sow herd are to be reduced by 25% and 30%, respectively, compared to 2015 levels, in order to reduce emissions by 46%.
<br />
<br />The head of agricultural policy at Climate Action Network, Cyrielle Denhartigh, confirmed that the herd reductions projected in the decarbonization strategy have not yet been made public.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, Pierre-Marie Aubert of the Paris Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI) says the technical assumptions in the strategy are &#34;very optimistic.&#34; He fears, however, that the reduction in livestock may not be enough to meet France&#39;s climate commitments.

<br />Surveillance camera captures deadly water tank explosion in Lemoore
<br />
<br />The City of Lemoore has declared a State of Emergency following the deadly water tank explosion Monday afternoon.
<br />
<br />The rupture of a 1.5-million-gallon city water tank has left the site out of operation.
<br />
<br />City officials released new footage Tuesday night that captured the moment the tank exploded, hurting a city employee and killing a contactor.
<br />
<br />“As a contractor started to weld, an explosion ensued, the tank separated from the ground, lifted approximately 70 feet vertically before a tsunami occurred, causing major damage to well site 7,” explained Lemoore City Manager Nathan Olson.
<br />
<br />Until the site is fixed, residents are urged to save water by not watering their lawns or using hoses to spray down concrete or cars.

									Looks like the images of massive hail across Iowa were representative.  We just lost 10-15% of their corn crop.  We are now decidedly below trend for 2021 corn yield.  And China has pre-purchased a lot of what we will get.
<br />
<br />Not a good sign.
<br />
<br />It is true that hailstorms increase during Grand Solar Minimum -- but this was weather warfare of great precision:  straight through the heart of US corn production, like the derecho last year.

									Mystery meat indeed.
<br />
<br />Even PCR testing (!) finds no tuna in Subway&#39;s tuna sandwich:
<br />
<br />The New York Times sent frozen samples of tuna meat ordered from three different Los Angeles-area Subway shops to a lab that specializes in fish testing, in order to determine how much tuna is in the tuna sandwiches. The world’s largest subway chain is caught in the middle of a class-action suit in California that claims the popular tuna subs are “completely bereft of tuna as an ingredient.” So the Times decided to analyze the sandwich’s main ingredient itself.
<br />
<br />The Subway tuna samples were run through a $500 PCR test — aka a polymerase chain reaction test, which detects genetic material from a specific organism by making millions or billions of copies from a DNA sample. The lab was looking for traces of one of five tuna species, including the skipjack and yellowfin tuna that Subway’s tuna and seafood sourcing statement says are used in its sandwiches.

									The CFR wants to deploy the US military to crack down on people fishing. 
<br />
<br />This is not a joke.  (Seems like I have to put that disclaimer on too many posts lately):
<br />
<br />&#34;Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing—known as IUU fishing—is a global scourge. Carried out by malicious actors in the shadows of the world’s oceans, it can devastate ecosystems, degrade food stocks, and undermine fragile fishing economies. A broad network of international partners, including U.S. civilian and military agencies, should work to eradicate this threat to the world’s shared prosperity.

									Illinois Ag. Department Illegally Seizes, Kills Privately Owned Bees Resistant to GMO Poison
<br />
<br />Terrence Ingram, a world renowned naturalist who once saved the Bald Eagle from being on the endangered species list, was recently met by the Illinois Agricultural Department which seized his privately-owned bees. The department seized his bees that were ‘resistant to GMO pesticides’ and killed the remaining healthy queen bees in his beehives.
<br />
<br />Ingram had been researching the effects of Roundup, the Monsanto franken-food best-selling herbicide meant to make crops more resilient to pests. Roundup itself has long list of negative effects, with the product even shown to kill human kidney cells. Much of the ill effects of Roundup are produced by the active ingredient, glyphosate.

<br />
<br />President Biden’s pick to run the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) argued in her graduate thesis nearly three decades ago that Americans should have no more than two children and claimed allowing livestock to graze on public land was “destroying the West.”
<br />
<br />Tracy Stone-Manning was already under fire from Republicans for her links to a so-called “tree-spiking” operation to sabotage logging efforts in Idaho in the late 1980s. Stone-Manning eventually agreed to testify against two people involved in the eco-terrorist operation in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

									N. Korea: Markets in Turmoil Across the Country: Households Register to Receive Chinese Aid and Trade Grinds to Halt as Food Prices Hit Yearly High
<br />
<br />The prices of staple foods such as white rice and corn, which had skyrocketed since the beginning of June, dropped on the 19th but rose sharply on the 22nd, reaching the highest prices of the year in many places. Several merchants have stopped trading with no change in sight, causing a growing sense of anxiety among residents (Kang Ji-won / Jiro ISHIMARU).
<br />
<br />Although there were slight price differences among the regions, the prices of white rice and corn soared. The average price in each area is as follows. Prices are in Korean won per kilogram.
<br />
<br />“Staple food prices have skyrocketed, and everyone is dying [IAF: figuratively.] . Since food prices have skyrocketed, merchants are reluctant to sell other products because they don&#39;t know what will happen to them in the future. Chinese products are no longer available, and domestic products have all gone up, so trading has stopped,” said a reporting partner living in Hoeryong.
<br />
<br />“The price hike is serious. I&#39;m afraid of what will happen next. The market managers, police officers, and price-fixing teams cracking down on high prices are too bewildered to intervene. Those who have the goods are not willing to sell them, and the market is barely functioning,&#34; said reporting partner living in Hyesan.

									Plague of grasshoppers:
<br />
<br />“In central Montana’s Phillips County, more than 50 miles from the nearest town, Frank Wiederrick said large numbers of grasshoppers started showing up on prairie surrounding his ranch in recent days. Already they’re beginning to denude trees around his house.
<br />
<br />“They’re everywhere,” Wiederrick said. “Drought and grasshoppers go together and they are cleaning us out.”
<br />
<br />Grasshoppers thrive in warm, dry weather, and populations already were up last year, setting the stage for an even bigger outbreak in 2021. Such outbreaks could become more common as climate change shifts rainfall patterns, according to “scientists.”
<br />
<br />To blunt the grasshoppers’ economic damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week began aerial spraying of the pesticide diflubenzuron to kill grasshopper nymphs before they develop into adults. Approximately 3,000 square miles in Montana are expected to be sprayed, roughly twice the size of Rhode Island.

									UK: Expect &#34;Rolling Blackouts&#34; of Food
<br />
<br />____________________
<br />
<br />Loss of 100,000 hauliers due to Covid and Brexit will cause food ‘rolling power cuts’, experts warn
<br />
<br />“I think it is going to be like a series of rolling power cuts in that we are going to see shortages, then shelves replenished, and shortages again. That is going to carry on for as long as demand is unpredictable and labour remains as tight as it is,” he added Brennan.
<br />
<br />“We firmly believe that intervention from the prime minister/Cabinet Office is the only way we will be able to avert critical supply chains failing at an unprecedented and unimaginable level. Supermarkets are already reporting that they are not receiving their expected food stocks and, as a result, there is considerable wastage,” it said.

									Boris Johnson’s food policy strategist says meat tax ‘may be necessary’ but warns of FOOD RIOTS if brought in too soon – reports
<br />
<br />After the UK’s government climate change advisers urged it to implement policy to reduce meat and dairy consumption, Boris Johnson’s hand-picked food strategy planner reportedly says a meat tax “may be necessary” in the future
<br />.
<br />Restaurateur Henry Dimbleby, chosen to lead Downing Street’s ‘National Food Strategy’ formulation body, believes that a levy on processed meat staples like burgers, steaks, ham, sausages, and chicken nuggets could be needed in order to tackle climate change, according to media reports.
<br />
<br />However, Dimblebly is expected to tell the prime minister not to introduce any such tax in the short-term because of the potential unrest it could lead to during the pandemic, according to The Sun.
<br />
<br />Citing unnamed sources familiar with a draft document due to be released next month, the paper noted that ministers fear street protests over food prices similar to those conducted by the ‘Gilets Jaunes’ (Yellow Vest) movement in France in recent years.

<br />
<br />The European Union banned imports or transfer of potash by the bloc from Belarus as part of its wide-ranging economic sanctions on Belarus on Thursday, a month after Minsk forced a Ryanair flight to land. read more
<br />
<br />Belarus will now need to find other countries and ports to ship its top export via the Baltic Sea.
<br />
<br />&#34;At first glance, this looks like a killer measure for the industry,&#34; said Vadim Iossub, senior analyst at Alpari Eurasia.
<br />
<br />The Baltic port of Klaipeda in Lithuania handles 97% of Belarusian potash exports - about 9.7 million tonnes a year. The potash exports are the main source of U.S. dollar revenue for Minsk&#39;s budget.

									Oxford University biochemist raises idea that mRNA shots CAN ABSOLUTELY modify DNA of those injected:
<br />
<br />“Our research suggests that polymerase theta&#39;s main function is to act as a reverse transcriptase,” says Dr. Pomerantz. “In healthy cells, the purpose of this molecule may be toward RNA-mediated DNA repair. In unhealthy cells, such as cancer cells, polymerase theta is highly expressed and promotes cancer cell growth and drug resistance.”
<br /> 
<br />“And how would it deal with messenger-RNA for a spike protein, following a Covid vaccination, one wonders? Could some version of that end up incorporated into your previously healthy DNA?” asked Chris Woollams, former Oxford University Biochemist and a founder of CANCERactive. “Surely, that must be one of the &#39;serious questions&#39; raised?”
<br />
<br />Full article:
<br />__
<br />
<br />Polymerase theta, present in human cells, has been found capable of copying foreign messenger-RNA in your cells and incorporating it into your personal DNA; it is highly expressed in cancer cells and drug resistance.
<br /> 
<br />It has long been believed that  polymerases worked only in one direction, copying DNA into RNA, avoiding any possibility of rogue RNA being copied and finding its way into your DNA blueprint.
<br /> 
<br />This system would prevent RNA from viruses or parasites or gut bacteria ‘accidentally’ being incorporated into your DNA blueprint.
<br /> 
<br />Unfortunately, this is no longer known to be true. it is now well established that HIV, for example, can have its RNA copied in the human body and the RNA can be incorporated into your DNA structure. This is because HIV uses its own ‘reverse polymerase’.
<br /> 
<br />Thomas Jefferson University researchers decided to look at human polymerases to see if any could act in this ‘reverse’ way and found that one, Polymerase theta, did just that.  “This work opens the door to many other studies that will help us understand the significance of having a mechanism for converting RNA messages into DNA in our own cells,” says Richard Pomerantz, PhD, associate professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Thomas Jefferson University. &#34;The reality that a human polymerase can do this with high efficiency, raises many questions.”
<br /> 
<br />It is conceivable that this system is some sort of ‘Failsafe’ mechanism, allowing copies of your own RNA to be made and then incorporated back in to repair problems that have arisen in your DNA. But what is to stop RNA from an external source being incorporated too?
<br /> 
<br />The researchers studied Pol theta and showed that it was capable of converting and incorporating RNA copies into your DNA and was as effective as the HIV reverse polymerase in doing this.
<br /> 
<br />In fact, Polymerase theta was more efficient and introduced fewer errors when copying an RNA template to write new DNA messages, than when copying DNA into DNA, suggesting that this RNA-copying function could be its primary purpose in the cell.
<br /> 
<br />The researchers also found Pol theta was uniquely able to change shape in order to accommodate the larger RNA molecules.
<br />
<br />&#34;Our research suggests that polymerase theta&#39;s main function is to act as a reverse transcriptase,&#34; says Dr. Pomerantz. &#34;In healthy cells, the purpose of this molecule may be toward RNA-mediated DNA repair. In unhealthy cells, such as cancer cells, polymerase theta is highly expressed and promotes cancer cell growth and drug resistance.&#34; 
<br />
<br />“And how would it deal with messenger-RNA for a spike protein, following a Covid vaccination, one wonders? Could some version of that end up incorporated into your previously healthy DNA?” asked Chris Woollams, former Oxford University Biochemist and a founder of CANCERactive. &#34;Surely, that must be one of the &#39;serious questions&#39; raised?&#34;

									So the lockdowns are officially for stopping us from talking...
<br />
<br />_
<br />
<br />HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, June 28, 2021:
<br />
<br />An injunction outlawing in-person gatherings has a purpose other than just to prevent the spread of COVID-19, according to Nova Scotia’s chief medical doctor. If people are allowed to be together, they might “deliberately” spread “false information that creates risk.”

<br />
<br />That heat dome -- it&#39;s climate change.
<br />
<br />&#39;This is not your grandparents’ climate...&#39;
<br />
<br />The western United States is currently under the influence of an epic heat dome, an expansive region of high atmospheric pressure characterized by heat, drought and heightened fire danger. It’s being called a once-in-a-millennium event, which means you might have expected to witness it once during your lifetime — if you happen to be Methuselah of biblical fame.
<br />
<br />All bets are off when one accounts for human-caused warming. It no longer makes sense to talk about a once-in-a-century or once-in-a-millennium event as if we’re just rolling an ordinary pair of dice, because we’ve loaded the dice through fossil fuel burning and other human activities that generate carbon pollution and warm the planet. It’s as if snake eyes, which should occur randomly only once every 36 times you rolled a pair of dice, were coming up once every four times.

									As UK shelves empty, the BBC elects to run a piece on the scientific merits of food rationing:
<br />
<br />A &#34;scientific genius&#34; whose work shaped Britain&#39;s World War Two food rationing is being honoured with a blue plaque.
<br />
<br />Elsie Widdowson and her colleague Robert McCance showed it was &#34;possible to live on a very simple diet&#34; of bread, vegetables and potatoes.
<br />
<br />Food rationing began in early 1940. It gave each person a scientifically-devised weekly allocation of food.
<br />
<br />Dr Ashwell said: &#34;They and a number of their colleagues ate only calcium-fortified bread, vegetables and potatoes.
<br />
<br />&#34;They then went on a rigorous course of cycling and mountain climbing in the Lake District in January 1940 to test out the diet&#39;s adequacy and delivered a report to the government in March which was used to develop the rationing policy.
<br />
<br />&#34;Of course, rations never got quite as bad as that - they were testing out an extreme.&#34;
<br />
<br />One of the most important things they advised on was the need to add calcium - in the form of powered chalk - to bread.
<br />
<br />Its addition by law continues today.

									More predictive rumblings about the &#34;imminent destruction of the $50bb US pork industry&#34; to ASF via wild hogs.
<br />
<br />__
<br />Wild Pigs Could Trigger Decimation of US Pork Industry
<br />
<br />What happens when wild pigs are given 1,000 tons of groceries per day in the form of landfill trash? Expect an explosion in pig and litter size, and quite possibly, a $50 billion decimation of the entire U.S. pork industry.
<br />
<br />The Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina has become ground zero for research drawing a nexus between wild pigs and the potential introduction of African swine fever (ASF) into the U.S. At an SRS location, wild pigs have grown notably bigger and birthed larger litters in just a handful of years, attributable to the establishment of a landfill—a veritable hog buffet. The SRS landfill and other similar refuse dumps across the U.S. may be ticking time bombs, and could open America’s door to ASF, an epic porcine disease with no vaccine or cure, and a century-long track record of sweeping over international borders and wiping out billions of pigs.

									California&#39;s historic drought is causing drinking water to taste like dirt. Just &#39;add lemon,&#39; officials say
<br />
<br />Something is off about Sacramento&#39;s water. It smells and tastes a little &#34;earthy,&#34; residents are saying — an effect of compounding climate change crises: extreme heat, little to no precipitation and a historic drought that has gripped the region for the better part of a decade.
<br />
<br />Up and down the state of California, rivers, streams and reservoirs are drying up. In Sacramento, that has led to an increase in the concentration of geosmin in its drinking water, one of two organic compounds that give soil its characteristic smell.
<br />
<br />It might not taste great, city officials say, but it&#39;s still safe to drink.
<br />
<br />Sacramento utilities officials said they had to put out a statement after receiving calls from residents complaining about the taste.
<br />
<br />&#34;We realize that it&#39;s unpleasant,&#34; Carlos Eliason, the city&#39;s utilities spokesperson, told CNN. &#34;The earthy taste that some of our customers are experiencing is harmless and can be neutralized by adding some lemon or putting it in the refrigerator.&#34;

<br />H-E-B is currently enforcing purchasing limits on chicken wings. 
<br />
<br />A notice in the meat section of the H-E-B store on Nogalitos alerted customers of the limit on Monday.
<br />
<br />Fresh and frozen wings are limited to two packs per transaction. Dya Campos, H-E-B&#39;s director of public affairs, said the limit applies to all stores. 
<br />
<br />&#34;Limits are temporary and necessary for you and your neighbors to find the products you need,&#34; the note said.
<br />
<br />A national wing shortage has affected local restaurants, such as Hello Paradise and the Anchor Bar. The latter implemented a 20-cent surcharge per wing in response to the increase in costs. Increased demand over the last year compounded with labor shortages threw the country into a wing shortage.
<br />
<br />Campos said the limits are in place to protect customers and said many retailers across the U.S. are facing the same issue. 
<br />
<br />&#34;It&#39;s your classic supply and demand issue with commodity items, but we think it will stabilize,&#34; she added. &#34;We&#39;ll keep limits so that customers can find the products that they need.&#34;

									Vice has published a hitpiece on myself and Dave DuByne from Adapt 2030.  This is essentially an attack caling for Patreon to de-platform, and an extension of calls for Youtube to deplatform/censor &#34;Koch-funded climate deniers.&#34;
<br />
<br />Note that their strawman argument is that we are arguing &#34;an impending ice age will fix the Earth’s global warming crisis&#34; -- not that the zero-carbon agenda is one of totalitarian control of humanity, or even natural solar cycles driving climate.  But I expect very little from Vice.
<br />
<br />The good news -- we&#39;re right over the target.
