      <description>Global Poultry Culling Doubles to 94.2 million kills as Food Shortage Crisis Deepens

The number of poultry culled around the world has almost doubled this season as global food shortages loom and the cost of living crisis deepens.

Experts are warning that an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù bird flu outbreak has caused a huge spike in culling since last season.

According to figures from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), more than 22 million cases have been reported in wild birds and poultry so far this season in 68 countries.

This figure is double the 11m recorded between October 2020 and September 2021, itself an all-time high.

In an effort to curb the outbreak, 94.2m farmed poultry have been killed and disposed of.

Last season, 54.4m were culled.

      <description>Finland: grocery stores may close to conserve power

Grocery stores in Finland could have to take turns closing for hours at a time to reduce their energy usage this winter, the country‚Äôs grid operator told news outlet YLE on Sunday. With fuel shortages expected, Finnish households will also be told to lower their consumption.

According to the grid operator, Finland‚Äôs roughly 2,800 food stores will need to come to arrangements with each other over who will close and who will stay open if power is rationed in a particular area. This kind of agreement is especially important in rural areas to ensure that all the outlets in one town or village don‚Äôt end up shutting at the same time, YLE noted.

      <description>WELL PUT: decarbonization strangling food production:

&gt;&gt; ‚ÄúA close friend farms over 10,000 acres of corn in the mid-west. The property is spread out over 3 counties. His operation is a "partnership farm" with John Deere. They use the larger farm operations as demonstration projects for promotion and development of new equipment. He recently received a phone call from his John Deere representative, and they want the farm to go to electric tractors and combines in 2023. He currently has 5 diesel combines that cost $900,000 each that are traded in every 3 years. Also, over 10 really BIG tractors. JD wants him to go all electric soon.

He said: "Ok, I have some questions.

- How do I charge these combines when they are 3 counties away from the shop in the middle of a cornfield, in the middle of nowhere?

- How do I run them 24 hours a day for 10 or 12 days straight when the harvest is ready, and the weather is coming in?

- How do I get a 50,000+ lb. combine that takes up the width of an entire road back to the shop 20 miles away when the battery goes dead?

There was dead silence on the other end of the phone.

When the corn is ready to harvest, it has to have the proper sugar and moisture content. If it is too wet, it has to be put in giant dryers that burn natural or propane gas, and lots of it. Harvest time is critical because if it degrades in sugar content or quality, it can drop the value of his crop by half a million dollars or more. It is analyzed at time of sale. It is standard procedure to run these machines 10 to 12 days straight, 24 hours a day at peak harvest time. When they need fuel, a tanker truck delivers it, and the machines keep going. John Deere's only answer is "we're working on it." They are being pushed by the Zero carbon agenda to force these electric machines on the American farmer.

These people are out of control. They are messing with the production of food crops that feed people and livestock... all in the name of their "green dream."
Look for the cost of your box of cornflakes to triple in the next 24 months...‚Äù

Wake up! Stand up! Speak up!
Let's return sanity to our nation.</description>

      <description>OPEN SOURCE INTEL: I‚Äôd posted to @iceagefarmer that I‚Äôd received many reports of poor germination and other issues from corporate seed sources, and asked people to share what they were seeing.

Over 700 people replied. Here is a summary; huge thanks to Kate B. for reviewing  compiling, and sharing.  It paints an interesting gestalt of a uniquely difficult season.  Original thread here.  (How's your garden doing?)

[ Join the garden group: @iaf_garden !  More groups: @iaf_groups ]

Just been through about 700+ comments from the US, Canada, Europe, UK, Sweden, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and beyond:

a) seeds are showing poor germination from a wide range of suppliers
b) those that do germinate and start to grow are doing so i) slower than usual  OR ii) are getting so far in their growth then dying (a bit like Tesco's herbs unless you transplant into fresh earth!) OR iii) are growing well but producing greenery not edible produce, so poor yields
c) suspicion is also falling on contaminated bagged compost -- many reports of issues here, some discussion around Grazon contamination
d) in addition, folks are noticing that store bought veg &amp; fruit is not lasting, plus some is rotten on opening although firm externally
e) suggestions also being made about soil alkalinity from chemtrails inhibiting growth
f) some people raising animals are getting all male babies [!?]
g) sunflowers &amp; other plants are being burnt up by the sun's rays
h) there is poor growth/yield from fruit trees
j) plentiful complaints from folks that have been growing for 25-40 years that things just aren't right with a degree of confusion as to the source
k) livestock feed prices are skyrocketing
l) many sick &amp; dead animals around this year &amp; dead birds found daily (Italy)
m)  too hot/ too dry/ no rain/ storms/ erratic weather with false forecasting
n)  absence of bees for pollination
p) cold nights inhibiting growth
q) abundance of pests &amp; bugs at levels not seen before
r)  zucchini with zero female flowers
s) blatant chemtrail spraying with some warning of "cancer in the ground for gardeners",
t) healthy hens stopping laying
u) pullets dropping dead at 6 months with no obvious cause
v) cooler spring so plants are a month behind
w) hard to get the cows/goats back in calf
x)  change in taste of store bought veg/fruit
y) salads are going straight to seed and bolting
z) overall poor germination &amp; growth - a weird growing year,

      <description>Beirut's 2020-Blast-Hit Grain-Silos Suddenly Collapse In Massive Plume Of Debris

Beirut's grain silos - that were massively damaged in 2020 - have suddenly collapsed this morning, sparking a huge cloud of smoke and debris.

[as more of our food supply chain spontaneously combusts‚Ä¶]

Everyone remembers the shocking images from August 5th 2020 as a massive blast, caused by an estimated 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse at the port unsecured for years, killed over 200 individuals and injured more than 6000.

      <description>California announces plan to charge landowners for their own water

It's not satire ‚Äî it's Agenda 2030 perfect awareness of all resources and economic activity.

California has announced to landowners that they now are going to be billed for the water they take out of their own wells, on their own land.  Hundreds of dollars in fees are looming, with 25% penalties for those who don't pay on time:

"Landowners whose property is within an unmanaged area and contains an operating ground water extraction well must report the volume of groundwater extracted from the well. The groundwater extraction volume must be reported as a monthly total. In addition to pumping volumes, reports must include the location of the well and the place and purpose of use of the groundwater. Groundwater extraction reports are not due to the state water board until February 1, 2023. However, if you are required to report, the report must include pumping volumes for each month between the date of receipt of this letter and September 30, 2022."

      <description>Beef prices set to surge further as farmers sell off/liquidate cattle herds

tl;dr: Beef prices are only just beginning to rise.

_____

U.S. cattle producers are sending higher numbers of breeding stock to the sale barn, and some are liquidating their herds entirely, signaling a trend that analysts say will likely push already-elevated beef prices even higher in the not-too-distant future.
The latest cattle report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows the market has contracted to levels not seen in years, with total inventory dropping 2% to 98.8 million head since July 2021.

UN, World Economic Forum Behind Global ‚ÄòWar on Farmers‚Äô: Experts

‚ÄòAgenda 2030' development goals at root of sustainability policies that could lead to food shortages

The escalating regulatory attack on agricultural producers from Holland and the United States to Sri Lanka and beyond is closely tied to UN Agenda 2030‚Äù Sustainable Development Goals and the U.N.‚Äôs partners at the World Economic Forum (WEF), numerous experts told The Epoch Times.
Indeed, several of the U.N.‚Äôs 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are directly implicated in policies that are squeezing farmers, ranchers, and food supplies around the world.

Ammonia production has been reduced considerably in German already because of high gas prices, said chemical industry lobby VCI.

IAF: And just today the EU intends to ration gas 15% across board ‚Äî this is a full crash, not a soft landing.

Exclusive: Thousands of U.S. cattle buried, dumped at Kansas landfill

Top U.S. cattle feeding companies sent 1,000-pound carcasses to a Kansas landfill, where they were flattened by loader machines and mixed with trash, after a June heatwave killed thousands of cows, documents seen by Reuters show.

Other cattle were buried in unlined graves, a feeding company said.

Neither is a typical method for disposing of bodies. But so many cows died in the unusual heat and humidity that facilities that normally convert carcasses into pet food and fertilizer products were overwhelmed, prompting the state government and cattle feeders to take emergency measures.

      <description>Rail delays / problems are mounting (even though the strike was delayed) ‚Äî it is a problem for this grain to not be moving.  Contributing to animal feed shortages and the degradation of the entire food supply chain:
__
Rail service delays in the past three months climbed a staggering 231% compared to a year ago, according to a new American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) analysis.
There were 204,000 unfilled grain car orders in the second quarter of 2022, compared to 62,000 last year, AFBF economist Daniel Munch said.

‚ÄúConditions have not im¬≠proved for shippers since our first quarter analysis,‚Äù said Munch, noting that the number of unfilled orders climbed 49% since the first...

      <description>tl;dr: European Commission predicts yield of wheat/barley/corn will be down 2.5% YoY due to drought, "experts" rush to blame climate change:

__
Europe is staring into one of its driest summers in living memory.

The drought has already crimped production of hydroelectric power and food, adding to market pressure from the war in Ukraine. Many city authorities have asked residents to cut back their use of drinking water.

With global food flows already squeezed, the drought has Europe‚Äôs farmers spooked. [IAF: perhaps not the word I would use for it.] Hungary's agriculture ministry said Wednesday that as of the beginning of the month it had received 8,413 drought damage notifications covering 322,000 hectares in 2022, three times the area of any previous first half of the year.

      <description>Friends, I will be on Coast to Coast AM tonight 10-11pm Pacific time with Ian Punnett, driving it home that the systems that fed and ran society are being attacked and systematically dismantled, and it is high time to grow food!

It should be a fun chance to reach a few million radio listeners, drop some solid red pills, but also offer hope!  Not sure if Ian will take calls this time, but see you there!

Tune in 10pm PT!  -&gt;

      <description>PANAMA CITY (AP) ‚Äî Three weeks of continuous demonstrations and road blockades to protest high fuel and food costs in Panama have begun to cause shortages of some food products, fuel and medicine.

The closures, including of the Pan-American Highway, have forced the national electric company to ration electricity in Darien province, which borders Colombia. Tankers carrying gas to run the power generation plant cannot arrive. Some 7,000 families have been affected by the reduction of electricity to 11 hours daily.

In Panama‚Äôs main wholesale market that supplies both supermarkets and individual consumers, there was little foot traffic Wednesday. Display tables usually stacked high with produce had far less on offer. Some vegetables like lettuce and tomatos, in particular, were in short supply.

      <description>It may seem as though all is in disarray and things are simply spiraling out of control.  But I must caution you that underneath that techno-fog of war, a machine continues to operate with great precision and efficiency.

That machine actively works to take land from farmers to construct massive ‚Äúcarbon pipelines‚Äù to carry CO2 and inject it deep into the earth to ‚Äústore it safely out of the atmosphere.‚Äù

The machine is taking prime farmland to construct massive solar farms ‚Äî in the heart of our corn belt in Indiana, Iowa , and Illinois just to pick three examples:

‚ÄúThis will be the last year that Norm Welker and his family harvests corn. But Welker will still be a farmer ‚Äî he‚Äôs going to farm the sun.

‚ÄúWelker is not alone: He is one of dozens of neighbors who are leasing their land for what will be the largest solar farm in the United States. At 13,000 acres [of prime crop land] it is aptly named the Mammoth Solar project and is a partnership between state of Indiana &amp; Israeli-based Doral Renewables LLC!!!!

These are just a few waves visible across a vast ocean of green agenda shutdowns, regulations, and takeover of farming and ranching.

&gt;&gt; Grow food. Raise animals. Support local farmers ‚Äî cultivate local food systems! &lt;&lt;

      <description>Russia Sends Combine Harvesters to Occupied Regions of Ukraine

Russia has sent combine harvesters from Crimea to two Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine to cover a shortage of equipment needed to bring in the crop, a representative of a Russian-installed local administration said.

The official said the harvesters were needed because "the equipment that was there before had either been dismantled or taken away by the previous owners outside the regions", he said. [IAF: By those who are consistently working to destroy global food production]

Evgeny Balitsky, head of the occupation administration in Zaporizhzhia, said on social media that these combine harvesters were provided by Russia's agriculture ministry.

      <description>Colder temps in Russia cause protein content in wheat to drop - even though the harvest is large, the prices of high-quality wheat are still rising:

__
Poor weather over parts of Russia's main producing regions is likely to mean that the supply of higher protein wheat will remain in relatively tight supply - supporting an increased price gap between quality milling wheats and lower quality grades, trade sources have told Agricensus.

Russia is on course to deliver its biggest ever wheat crop, but higher yields and rains over some of the main Russian producing regions mean the crop currently being harvested is showing more 11.5% or feed grades were harvested so far compared to last year.

The price gap between the 12.5%, 11.5%, and feed wheat grades have been increasing over the last week with a gap of almost $16-17/mt seen between 11.5% and 12.5% grades in coaster-sized CIF Marmara trades last week, but offers on a deep sea port basis have also widened to show the same $17/mt differential.

      <description>Macron announces "Turn off your lights" as it becomes clear Russia will not continue providing gas:

"French President Emmanuel Macron warned his country‚Äôs people Thursday to prepare for a total cutoff of Russian natural gas by supporting alternatives, having public lights switched off at night and engaging in a period of nationwide energy ‚Äúsobriety.‚Äù

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and ensuing sanctions have aggravated other factors driving up prices for energy and others goods. With no end in sight for the Ukraine war, Macron said, the French should brace themselves for costs to remain high.

‚ÄúThis war will continue,‚Äù he said in a televised interview marking France‚Äôs national holiday, Bastille Day. ‚ÄúThe summer, early autumn will be very hard.‚Äù"

      <description>Italy's PM Draghi resigns. So:

- Italy's Draghi is out
- UK's Boris Johnson is out
- Abe is eliminated in Japan
- Estonia's PM has resigned
- Irish government - no confidence vote
- Dutch protests continue to gain steam ‚Äî German farmers are joining

Amazing how quickly things are moving.  Expect more as the West continues to be destroyed from within ... (as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt move towards BRICS!)

In other words, Andrey should already be worried about corn.

And about the culling of cattle herds happening now in Texas drought.

Grow your garden folks. Things are getting rough, and accelerating quickly.

      <description>Italian onion harvest starts with lower yield due to drought

The onion harvest in the southern Italian province of Bari is underway and it appears that yields are already declining. "We are now in the middle of the harvest and we are trying to move up a gear to get ahead of any weather change. We needed rain in April and May, not now," said Vito Abrusci, director of the growers' association La Vera Cipolla Rossa di Acquaviva delle Fonti.

      <description>‚ÄúWhat happens after they burn down the farms?"

ANSWER:

EU‚Äôs Plan to Replace Farms ‚Äì CITIES2030 ‚Äì Digital Twin of Food Supply (nov 2021)

As our food supply is systematically dismantled, the EU is funding a project to create ‚ÄúUrban Food Systems‚Äù and a blockchain-based ‚Äúdigital twin‚Äù platform to track indoor farming and synthetic meat from laboratory to plate to sewers. Is this an organic response to a crisis, or a nefarious plan, generations in the making, being realized before our eyes? Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

      <description>Ghana:  food shortages hit schools as students drink porridge without bread and sugar

There appears to be a serious food shortage in Senior High Schools in the country. This is a result of the poor food supply situation in the schools which is reported to have reached dire and deteriorated levels.

He said the students are given porridge without milk, sugar, and bread adding that "Dear parents, these are our boys, and as a parents association, we have less than GH¬¢1,000 in our coffers. What can this do?"

The Headmaster of St Augustine's, Henry Arthur-Gyan, also said the school had no option but to manage the situation.  "We know there are challenges and so we manage with what we are provided. There is not much we can do about it," he stated.

[ @iceagefarmer note:  expect media to play up school food shortages as a key concept in the Rockefeller ‚ÄòReset the Table‚Äô agenda is to use schools as ‚Äúnutritional hubs‚Äù for communities ]

      <description>Cattle producers struggling with high cost of feed

‚ÄúMost beef producers in this area have their cattle out on grass now, so they don‚Äôt have to buy hay or grain. But it‚Äôs going to be a problem in the fall; it‚Äôs difficult to make a profit in this business when you have to pay $8 or $9 for a bushel of grain to help these cattle through the cold winters,‚Äù Balicki said. ‚ÄúAnd, you do have to give cattle grain in this part of the world, because they need the energy to keep warm. So that‚Äôs a huge concern.‚Äù

      <description>UK dairy farmers warn of price rises amid chronic staff shortages

Dairy farmers are warning that a chronic shortage of workers is hitting milk production and further fuelling food price inflation, and are calling for urgent action to stop the situation getting worse.

Eight in 10 farm owners looking for workers said they had received very few or zero applications from people with the right experience or qualifications, in response to a survey by Arla Foods, the UK‚Äôs largest dairy co-operative.

      <description>European energy crisis has boiled over ‚Äî things on the continent are about to change, rapidly and more absolutely than most can imagine:

- Germany: is restricting when and how energy companies can declare force majeure;

- France: has just nationalized the nation‚Äôs largest energy company, EDF;

- UK: announced they, too, would simply cut off natgas to the EU when supply is short;

- The EU has decided that nuclear and natural gas energy are ‚Äúgreen‚Äù after all, a semantic change which only marginally lengthens the runway for their ‚Äòdecarbonization transition‚Äô

These are major moves that signal the hard landing ahead ‚Äî brace for impact, my friends.

      <description>AWFUL:  animal feed shortages reported in the USA as deliveries remain scarce:

‚ÄùThe point has been reached when millions of chickens will be killed and other livestock will suffer because of UP‚Äôs [IAF: that is WEF partner Union Pacific] service failures,‚Äù Foster Farms wrote in its request to the Surface Transportation Board this week.

Rail bottlenecks in the U.S. are not improving, and in some cases, growing more severe. Feed users in California and the Southwest are having issues sourcing grain, with some reporting they are paying $3 over the CBOT price to secure grain by truck. Not only are feed users on the brink of running out of grain, but there are also concerns the rail issues could grow worse during harvest this fall.

[ plenty of ideas on how to grow your own animal feed in @iaf_birds ! ]

      <description>EXPERTS WARN: MASK UP IN THE GARDEN!

This explosion of cardiac issues? It‚Äôs because people started gardening during the pandemic.

Gardening is DIRTY and DANGEROUS and can KILL YOU ‚Äî you should ONLY eat fake meat and bugs.  NEVER GARDEN.  You will be SAFE inside away from DIRTY animals and DANGEROUS soil.

[These people will stop at nothing to control your food supply!]

__

Urgent warning to gardeners as soil ‚Äòincreases risk of killer heart disease‚Äô

Medics found that pollutants in the soil could have a 'detrimental effect on the cardiovascular system'.  ‚ÄúContaminated soil could lead to increasing oxidative stress in the blood vessels, which in turn leads to heart disease.‚Äù

Dirty soil can get into the blood stream, through inhalation.

      <description>Unscheduled power outages result in high chicken mortalities - some farmers give up as Incubators run cold, freezers full of product thaw out, and losses mount.

__
Power grid ‚ÄúLoad shedding‚Äù drops certain zones deemed non-critical ‚Äî but this is causing farmers to lose their animals!

Deidre Carter, CEO of Agri Limpopo, said one of the organisation‚Äôs members had reported losing about 2 000 broiler chickens in a single day due to Eskom‚Äôs unilateral load-reduction strategy, while another had decided to leave the poultry industry altogether.

‚ÄúLoad reduction is a lot worse than [rolling blackouts], because one never knows when or how long the power will be out,‚Äù she told Farmer‚Äôs Weekly.

      <description>"Hot water at night is a luxury that you can no longer afford"

The zero-carbon agenda is cold and miserable.

A housing cooperative near Dresden had announced that it would only provide hot water at certain times. The reason: the high gas prices. Federal Building Minister Geywitz criticized that this was "illegal".The announcement by a Saxon housing cooperative to restrict the hot water supply has met with massive criticism in politics. Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) told the newspapers of the Funke media group: "Simply turning off the hot water temporarily is illegal."

Anger has intensified after the government revealed the same nitrogen cuts, being proposed in the name of fighting climate change, won‚Äôt be applied to the airline industry.

      <description>CO2 shortage threatens New Zealand chicken supplies

Plans are in progress to reduce production of some chicken products, according to the country‚Äôs leading poultry meat producer.

Tegel is warning that it may not be able to produce some chicken products because of a shortage of carbon dioxide gas in New Zealand that is also threatening brewers and fizzy drinks makers.

The Food and Grocery Council said the availability of cheese, preserved meats, sparkling wine and ready-to-eat meals could also suffer, with price rises possible.

The Brewers Association and the Beverage Council separately voiced concerns about the gas shortage on Saturday.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is used widely in the food industry ‚Äì including in packaging to preserve the shelf life of chicken ‚Äì and to add fizz to drinks, as well as in other industries such as healthcare.

Businesses used to get much of their CO2 supply from the Marsden Point oil refinery, which produced CO2 as a by-product of its refining operation until that was replaced in favor of importing energy.

      <description>Libya declares force majeure on oil exports after weeks of protests and port blockades.

This is major news on its own, but also needs to be considered from Europe's perspective:

- 6% of EU oil &amp; gas imports are from Libya and were just taken off the table.
- 34% of EU oil and 55% of gas comes from Russia, which is being throttled
- Freeport terminal in TX was blown up and cannot send LNG
- UK just announced they'd stop gas exports to EU if there were shortages
- EU and UK are both frantically burning gas just to generate electricity now, instead of storing for the winter ahead!

- Greenhouses, food plants and facilities are ALREADY SHUT DOWN due to the cost of energy ‚Äî and somehow things keep blowing up!  This is an absolute CONTROLLED DEMOLITION.

Europe is being strangled !!

People with COVID-19 can infect and sicken cats and dogs by cuddling them, says study

The study said that while it was already known that animals including cats, dogs, ferrets and hamsters seem to be susceptible to COVID-19, transmission may be happening more often than previously thought.

"These data indicate relatively common transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to animals and that certain human-animal contacts ‚Äî example, kissing the pet, pet sleeping on the bed ‚Äî appear to increase the risk," said the study.

Transmission from humans to animals can be minimized by owners keeping their distance, wearing a mask and taking other precautions, just as they would to prevent infecting a person, he said.

      <description>No Russian Gas -&gt; No Eggs!  Farmers warn an energy crisis is ALSO a FOOD CRISIS.

Without natural gas supplies, there are immediate animal welfare problems on the farms. From the hatchery to the barn to the slaughterhouse, all companies in the poultry industry are dependent on the energy source.  [IAF:  and thus, these are being shut down by design.]

Short-term energy restrictions would have "an immediate impact on the food security of the residents".

The poultry industry is energy-intensive. "For the Lower Saxony poultry industry alone, including the production of poultry feed [!!!] we have calculated an annual gas requirement of around 1,735,311 megawatt hours."

      <description>Ukraine: gain exports plummet 44% year over year:

Ukraine exported 1.11 million tonnes of grain in the first 22 days of June, down 44% from the same period in 2021, Reuters reported, citing agriculture ministry data released June 27.

The volumes included 978,000 tonnes of corn, 104,000 tonnes of wheat and 24,000 tonnes of barley, the data showed. Ukraine exported up to 6 million tonnes of grain a month before Russia launched an invasion on Feb. 24.

Ukraine is among the world‚Äôs largest exporters of wheat and corn. Exporters are struggling to get what‚Äôs left in storage out of the country, because Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea, like the key city of Odessa, are under blockade by Russia.

      <description>Possible foot and mouth disease case investigated at pig farm in Norfolk (UK)

A¬†possible outbreak of foot and mouth disease¬†is being investigated at a Norfolk pig farm - sparking major worries for the region's livestock industry.

Defra has enforced a 10km Temporary Control Zone for foot and mouth disease at a farm between Feltwell and Brandon.

The precautionary measure¬†was put in place at 10pm on Thursday¬†"following suspicion of vesicular disease in pigs".

      <description>BOOM ! Suddenly it's YOUR backyard chickens that are causing pandemics, not industrial agriculture.  This was the plan all along to take total control over food production!

 &gt; "If we can‚Äôt dramatically cut meat consumption then intensive ‚Äòfactory farming‚Äô may be comparatively less risky" because ‚Äúnon-intensive‚Äù or ‚Äúlow-yield‚Äù farms [IAF: ie. anyone producing their own food other than large industrial technocrat owned operations] pose a serious risk to human health as they need far more land to produce the same amount of food [this is also a lie!].

"This, it is argued, increases the chances of ‚Äúspillover‚Äù of dangerous viruses between animals and humans because it drives habitat loss, which displaces disease-carrying wild animals such as bats and rodents and brings them into closer contact with farmed animals and humans."

... and this builds on that weird Fauci paper blaming all pandemics on humans interacting with nature ‚Äî the goal is to divorce man from God's creation. #transhumanism

      <description>AUS: Fruit and vegetable costs to skyrocket in coming weeks

Aussies are being warned the price of all fruit and vegetables will spike in coming weeks as farmers face labor shortages and growing production costs.

Tyson Cattle, from the national industry representative AusVeg, told Today the issues were critical and "impacting grower confidence to plant more crops".

"They're unable to access the pickers and packers needed to actually get crops off the ground and onto supermarket shelves," Tyson told Today.

      <description>Dutch farmers protest government's decision to cut chicken flocks by 30% for "nitrogen savings"

The War on Meat continues...

The Netherlands, the world's second-largest agricultural exporter, is one of the top greenhouse gas emitters in Europe -- especially of nitrogen -- with much of this blamed on cattle-produced manure and fertiliser.

Farmers say they are targeted while big business and industry slide, with many vowing to resist any plans to scale down or close farms.

"It's not normal, what's being done to the farmers," 74-year old protester Jan Poorter told AFP. ""You can't just close farms that are hundreds of years old. You just can't!"

      <description>Iranian schools, hospitals facing food shortages as prices skyrocket

Local media in Iran say public institutions such as hospital, prisons, and child-care centers are facing possible food shortages due to skyrocketing prices.

The Tehran-based Etemad newspaper reported on June 15 that the impending ‚Äúproblem‚Äù could hit in ‚Äúthe coming weeks‚Äù and that ‚Äúfood supplies will be disrupted not only in hospitals but also in other government facilities such as barracks, prisons, nursing homes, and even student dormitories.‚Äù

Etemad quoted the head of a private hospital as saying that a sharp rise in food prices has affected the quality of hospital food to such an extent that freshly made items are likely to be eliminated in public and private hospitals, with packaged foods being used instead.

The head of the hospital, who asked not to be identified, added: ‚ÄúIn the coming weeks, it will be impossible for many public or private medical centers to provide hot meals, especially protein-rich foods, to hospitalized patients because this increase in food prices was not seen in any hospital budget.‚Äù
