      <description>UN warns of food catastrophe

Without fertilizers, shortages will spread from corn and wheat to all staple crops, including rice, with a devastating impact on billions of people in Asia and South America, too. This year’s food crisis is about lack of access.  Next year’s could be about lack of food,” he added.

Unfortunately, dozens of countries may face a physical shortage of food. Millions of people may starve if Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea continues.

      <description>Bad grains harvest forecast for EU - including France, who is usually exporter

Worsens global outlook for #wheat shortages

"The EU is expected to produce almost 5% less wheat this year compared with 2021. It was also forecast to produce 278.8 million metric tons of all grains in the 2022-2023 growing season, down over 4% from last year, because of the dry weather.

Production in France, which is the fifth-largest grower of wheat in the world, was also projected to decline by more than 5%. The country accounts for about 18% of European agricultural production, according to the French Ministry of Agriculture. France is also the fourth-biggest wheat exporter globally.

In addition to dry weather, the country’s agricultural land has been hit with severe storms, that damaged wheat, fruit and vineyard land.

      <description>"Large supply gaps in turkey will begin Q3." Bird Flu was confirmed in "our supply chain" in March. A top US food processing company warned of an upcoming shortage of its turkey products at supermarkets following one of the worst bird flu outbreaks.

"Our Jennie-O Turkey Store team is facing an uncertain period ahead," Hormel Foods Corporation CEO Jim Snee told investors in an earnings call.

Since the USDA first detected bird flu in the US in mid-February, more than 38 million birds in 35 states have died. Out of that figure, 5 million turkeys in the US have been killed, with most deaths in Minnesota and South Dakota.

      <description>New rules will effectively shut down U-Pick farms in NSW Australia — read more here and sign the petition if you are in the area:

“They currently have a proposal underway to deciminate all the Pick your own farms in NSW and want to put unrealistic limitations on the number of visitors per day that attend these farms.  The current proposal they have is to only allow 50 people per day to attend the farms and a maximum of 10 days per year that these farms  are allowed to open for PYO.”

      <description>German Farmers warn food prices will continue to escalate

The conflict in Ukraine and its economic fallout have had “a massive impact on German agriculture,” Joachim Rukwied, president of the German Farmers’ Association, said in an interview with the Passauer Neue Presse.

“Energy prices have doubled, the price of fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizers, has quadrupled on average, and fodder costs more,” he explained, adding that the situation was “disastrous” for pig farmers in particular.

According to Rukwied, food has been sold below value in recent years, and prices have to go up for farmers to be able to continue to farm at all. Inflation in Germany hit 7.9% in May, according to official statistics, reaching its highest level since reunification. The levels are also similar to those seen during the 1970s oil crisis.

      <description>Doctors baffled by increase in “Sudden Adult Death Syndrome” (SADS)

Sudden Adult Death Syndrom (SADS) is an “umbrella term to describe unexpected deaths in young people” and an increase in these ‘mysterious’ deaths in Australia is said to have left doctors in the country baffled.

Doctors hope to roll out a new SADS registry across the country in order to monitor this sudden death phenomenon.

Experts are Baffled…

      <description>Is US/NATO (with WEF help) pushing for a Global South famine?

Is the proxy war in Ukraine turning out to be only a lead-up to something larger, involving world famine and a foreign-exchange crisis for food- and oil-deficit countries?

Many more people are likely to die of famine and economic disruption than on the Ukrainian battlefield.

“Russia accounts for 40% of the world’s grain trade and 25 percent of the world fertilizer market (45 percent if Belarus is included). Any scenario would have included a calculation that if so large a volume of grain and fertilizer was withdrawn from the market, prices would soar, just as they have done for oil and gas.

      <description>Biden calls on farmers to produce "double crop" (but does nothing to help them with the exploding operational costs), yet invokes the Defense Production Act to produce solar panels.  And again raises the ethanol requirements (burn more corn for fuel)!

This is not just climate virtue signaling - it is the state taking control of the economy and misallocating resources to green nonsense that does not solve our energy problems, while depriving funding to traditional farming and ranching that could actually produce food.

This is an engineered food crisis.

      <description>South Africa:  ports unable to export food:

The Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) recently said that South Africa’s agricultural sector is being hit by bottlenecks at South African ports, adding that there is a struggle to get table grapes out into international markets within 21 days – currently it takes 50 days.

“Perishable cargo like fruit is only covered by specific extensions to cover delay and this is provided by a limited number of insurers. The number of insurers who offered the extended cover are now declining this cover due to the increased delays in worldwide shipping from 2020 that is ongoing. The infrastructure troubles we are having, as well as the result of the KZN floods, is likely to add further delays, which may result in insurers no longer offering delay cover at all.”

      <description>Spain: 80% of stone fruit production lost

Frosts took a severe toll on pome and stone fruit trees in northeastern Spain in late March. The production in the regions of Aragon and Catalonia suffered historic volume losses in a year in which production costs have soared due to inflation.

"We have lost 80% of our stone fruit production," said Sergio Alonso, commercial director of the Cosanse cooperative in Zaragoza. In the case of cherries, the damage has not been as severe and we have been able to save 50-60% of the production, while in that of apples and pears we will have 60-70% of the production.

      <description>The Russian government plans to allow ships carrying grain supplies to leave the port of Odessa in Ukraine, according to a report, easing a blockade that has triggered fears of widespread shortages and hunger.

The Russian leadership has agreed with Kyiv and Ankara on a scheme to release grain shipments from Odessa, which has been subject to a blockade, the pro-government Izvestia reported, citing government circles.

"In the territorial waters of the neighboring country, Turkish military forces will take over the demining and they will also escort the ships as far as neutral waters," Monday's report said.

Russian warships would then escort the vessels carrying grain to the Bosporus. https://www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/turkey-russia-agree-on-ukrainian-grain-exports-from-odessa-izvestia</description>

      <description>Egypt BANS all transactions of wheat other than selling to the government.  This is the next domino to fall as the big producers ban exports — countries that need imports (like Egypt) start to take total control of what remains and ration it:

—
Egypt banned trading of wheat by third parties until the end of August, the cabinet said on Tuesday, preventing any sales other than to the government.

Egypt aims to buy the whole harvest from local farmers, as it targets 6 million tonnes of domestic wheat this year after the Ukraine war cut it off from much of the Black Sea wheat it relied on.

      <description>U.S. wheat crop hit by dry winter then soggy spring, adding to global tightness

North Dakota farmer Dwight Grotberg wanted to plant more wheat this spring to capitalize on soaring prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine cut grain exports and left the world short of millions of tonnes of wheat supply.

Heavy rain has prevented Grotberg from planting as much wheat crop as he wanted and is hampering farmers across the state, the top U.S. grower of spring wheat.

Tens of thousands of chickens burned at the farm, started in 1918, sold more than three million eggs a day to some of the nation’s largest retailers.

      <description>IRAN: Digital Food Rationing rolls out using Biometric IDs amid food riots

Iran is set to be the first country to roll out a food rationing scheme based on new biometric IDs.  Where vaccine passports failed, food passports will now be eagerly accepted by hungry people who can't afford rapidly inflating food prices.  This is the realization of a longstanding agenda by the Rockefeller/UN/WEF crowd to, as Kissinger put it, "control food, and control people."  Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

      <description>Cows may need permit to graze meadows in Netherlands

Dairy farmers are angry and surprised now that a court decision opens the door to a  permit requirement to let cows roam in the meadow. “This shows the absurdity of the nitrogen policy,” says Trienke Elshof, a farmer in Oldetrijne.

      <description>Amish Farmer Faces $250K Fine, Jail Time And Losing His Sustainable Farm For Processing His Own Meat

A federal judge told Miller to cease and desist all meat sales, and sent armed U.S. marshals to search his property, farm store and freezers. They took an inventory of all his meat to make sure he doesn’t sell any or slaughter anymore animals.

Last summer, the judge also ordered Miller to pay $250,000 for “contempt of court,” and said he will also have to pay the salaries of the USDA investigators assigned to his case, $50,000 of which was due last week as a “good faith” payment to avoid jail.

      <description>Farmers left heartbroken as Queensland floods ruin crops

Shoppers warned the price of fresh fruit and vegetables will rise after latest rain event

Farmers who risked planting after the February deluge lost entire crops and face financial ruin after the second deluge.

Lockyer Valley’s mayor, Tanya Milligan, said crops were rotting in the ground and 90% of insurance claims have been rejected.

“A lot of those farmers were hoping and depending on that (insurance payout),” Milligan said.

“We will have farmers that have no intention to replant. You have people that have just lost absolutely everything and they will be wondering is it all worth it?

      <description>Never seen such an honest appraisal from a public servant of an absolutely catastrophic situation as Sri Lanka’s new prime minister just shared - full transcript is linked, and worth reading:

“The next couple of months will be the most difficult ones of our lives. We must prepare ourselves to make some sacrifices and face the challenges of this period.
I have no desire to hide the truth and to lie to the public. Although these facts are unpleasant and terrifying, this is the true situation. For a short period, our future will be even more difficult than the tough times that we have passed. We will face considerable challenges and adversity.

      <description>Note that Iran plans to use "Digital Coupons" to get bread.  “Other food items will be added later."  -- We are already arriving at digital food rationing.

Soaring bread prices spark protests and shop fires in Iran

Soaring bread prices have triggered protests in Iran in which some shops were set on fire, prompting police to arrest scores of "provocateurs"

The protests were triggered by a cut in government subsidies for imported wheat that caused price hikes as high as 300 percent for a variety of flour-based staples.

Iran’s official inflation rate is around 40%, and some estimate it is over 50%. Almost half Iran’s 82 million population are now below the poverty line.

The government plans to offer digital coupons in the next couple of months for limited amounts of bread at subsidised prices. The rest will be offered at market rates. Other food items will be added later.

      <description>Italy: African Swine Fever prompts culling of 2.1 million boar, export bans

The European Union on Monday told Italy to establish an infected zone for African swine fever in areas of Rome and implement special control measures to stop it spreading.

    It said Italy must "ensure that consignments of porcine animals kept in the areas listed as an infected zone... and products thereof are not authorised for movements to other Member States and to third countries".

    The government plans to cull wild boar, after several cases of swine fever were detected in Rome and with the animals becoming increasingly brazen about their encroachments into residential areas as they forage, especially in the capital.

    The Rome cases, which rose to six Friday, are the first outside the area of the original outbreak in Liguria and Piedmont.

    The authorities said two more cases were found in Liguria on Monday, taking the total for that region and Piedmont up to 119.

    The Coldiretti farm group said some 2.1 million boar needed to be culled in Italy as "a real risk to public safety". (ANSA).

      <description>It’s gone from a few stories to something I’m hearing again and again across states:  some birds die — no usual signs of bird flu — state comes in and runs PCR, declares outbreak and kills birds all around for miles.

Contaminated feed, even just one brand, would be a great excuse to come in and wipe out poultry producers like this.

If anyone is losing birds and able to test their feed, please do reach out and share results: iceagefarmer@protonmail.com

      <description>Egypt buys half a million tonnes of wheat from India:

[IAF: This purchase was pending before India announced their ban — will be interesting to see price point.]

Egypt has four months' worth of strategic at reserves and six months of vegetable oils, the country's prime minister said earlier in the day.

Egypt, one of the world's biggest wheat importers, is looking for alternatives to Black Sea grain exports which face disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, both major wheat exporters to Egypt.

      <description>The storm this week may prove to have been as damaging as the last Derecho - grain bins destoyed, on farm storage lost.  Irrigators broken — and there are NO replacement parts available = lost acreage.

Had a lot of reports of damage and certainly some compelling images floating on Twitter - will wait to draw conclusions but at this point any damage to our crop is significant:

“The storm could compound struggles as farmers face delayed planting, soaring input costs and pressure to increase production amid record-high food prices and fears of shortages”

      <description>Huge: India has banned wheat exports that world needed without Ukraine:

Have long said to watch wheat —

India Bans Wheat Exports in Growing Wave of Food Protectionism

India prohibited wheat exports that the world was counting on to alleviate supply constraints sparked by the war in Ukraine, saying that the nation’s food security is under threat. 
Exports will still be allowed to countries that require wheat for food security needs and based on the requests of their governments. All other new shipments will be banned with immediate effect.

      <description>FARMER SAYS PARTS AVAILABILITY REMAINS A CHALLENGE THIS SPRING

Supply chain issues continue to create logistical problems, and a Tennessee farmer says it all depends on what he needs.

David Nichols says it hasn’t been easy.  “But so far we’ve been able to keep crop protection products, the chemistry side of things, in-house,” he says.  Nichols, who farms in south Tennessee, tells Brownfield parts are a different story. “I have a neighbor who has a turbocharger issue and they can’t source one,” he says.  “It’s been a national type search for it and it’s just not there.  We’re still seeing those supply issues impact us.”

Nichols says he’s about a month behind his typical planting pace, and is hopeful he can play catchup this week.

      <description>Ukraine cuts Russian gas to Europe, threatening energy supply

Kiev cites "force majeure" to halt a third of Russian transited gas flow to Europe, while Gazprom says there have been no issues that would justify the move.

Gas from this connection will not be accepted into the transit system of Ukraine starting at 7 am on Wednesday, OGTSU said. Sokhrankovka accounts for almost a third of the Russian gas that transits through Ukraine to Europe – up to 32.6 million cubic meters per day – according to the operators.

[IAF:  German energy ministers confirm their supply is as low as 2-3 weeks.  Keep an eye on Europe.]

Russian gas conglomerate Gazprom has received no confirmation of force majeure or any obstacles to continued transit of gas through a junction in Lugansk Region, the company said on Tuesday, after Ukraine’s operator OGTSU announced it would halt further deliveries starting May 11, due to the presence of “Russian occupiers.”

Gas Transit Services of Ukraine (OGTSU) declared force majeure on Tuesday, saying that it was impossible to continue the transit of gas through a connection point and compressor station located in the Lugansk area.

      <description>EVACUATE THE GRAIN:

Nearly 25 million tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine, says UN food agency

Nearly 25 million tonnes of grains are stuck in Ukraine and unable to leave the country due to infrastructure challenges and blocked Black Sea ports including Mariupol, a U.N. food agency official said on Friday.

“It’s an almost grotesque situation we see at the moment in Ukraine with nearly 25 mln tonnes of grain that could be exported but that cannot leave the country simply because of lack of infrastructure, the blockade of the ports,” Josef Schmidhuber, FAO Deputy Director, Markets and Trade Division told a Geneva press briefing via Zoom.

Schmidhuber said the full silos could result in storage shortages during the next harvest in July and August.

Head of the WTO announced, “It would really help the world if we could evacuate this grain (from Ukraine),” — Earlier this week, the head of the World Trade Organization told Reuters she was “seriously worried” about spiraling food prices and seeking solutions alongside other partners.

      <description>Maine lobster industry fighting shutdown for ‘endangered whale’

Like the Canadian fishers and all the other food producers that have been regulated or shutdown since 2020 - in many cases there are fights going on in the courts. But what’s more significant is that all these legal battles flow from a calculated wave of shutdowns in disparate areas and industries,  happening in concert, in a year while everyone was confused.

They shook up the nest and then threw a web over producers around the world.

      <description>India has now flip-flopped and announced they are NOT limiting exports.

I wonder what conversations are going on behind the scenes to motivate an announcement in order to protect domestic food prices, and then suddenly a retraction to continue exporting for now.

      <description>BREAKING: India mulls export limits on wheat.

We went from “India will step in to cover the Ukraine wheat” to new export limits in about a month.

This is huge. With other major exporters already limiting, Black Sea not shipping, US having worst wheat since ‘89, China worst on record - this really signals the “protectionist” policies (ie keep our food domestic!) will now spread everywhere. And importers are in real trouble.

      <description>Food Supply Shutdown :  Deer, fish, pigs euthanized; crops not planted

An observing alien species would ask itself, "Why is humanity destroying ALL of their food sources?"  In this special Ice Age Farmer broadcast, Christian has a candid conversation about the overwhelming number of attacks on our food supply and animals.  With crops unplanted and with more food facilities burning down, the media runs stories about "food fire conspiracy theories."  And it's not just chickens -- the state is also killing deer and fish in the name of stopping diseases.  Start growing food now.

      <description>“Central Bank Digital Currencies are Tools for Freedom”

We have literally reached the “slavery is freedom” slogan from 1984!  And note the exaples:

"Should people be encouraged to eat the foods decided best for them, such as a plant or insect-based diet? CBDCs could do the trick. Should people be limited in how much they can spend per week on carbon-intensive purchases? CBDCs could help with that too,” N.S. Lyons, author of The Upheaval Substack, wrote last week in conservative-leaning digital mag City Journal.

      <description>Australia: pork supply set to plunge as Japanese encephalitis detected across piggeries

Experts say Japanese encephalitis will impact pork supply as infected piggeries experience production losses of up to 80 per cent.  There are now 30 New South Wales piggeries affected by the mosquito-borne virus and 11 people have been infected, with three deaths nationwide.

"It's also the mental health impact on the people, because there's been a lot of stillborn or abortions or abnormalities in piglets … which can be very stressful seeing … day in, day out."

The disease has no impact on the safety of consuming pork, but Dr Britton said production losses were likely to affect availability.

"I think it will affect the supply of pork, because it has impacted a number of the bigger properties as well as some of the smaller ones," she said.

      <description>My friends,

As the engineered food crisis has gained traction in mainstream awareness, I started writing a pamphlet/book with the purpose of helping to shepherd people out of the grocery store and into growing food as part of an emergent, decentralized food system.

The book is a run through the most important things I've learned through years of conversations about food sovereignty, in a context of immediately standing up systems to endure (and fight) the technocratic takeover of food.  "Assume crash position!"

I wanted to share this news early, rather than be too quiet the new project.  If you are interested in the book or have any thoughts on what belongs in a "victory garden lightning course," I'd love to hear from you!  Drop a comment or email.

Warmly,
Christian

      <description>Latest USDA report had tight ending stocks across several grains &amp; oilseeds.

“A bumper crop is needed.”

The cold temps and excessive rains have kept farmers out of the fields, delaying planting.  When considered also with fertilizer and other input shortages … a bumper crop can not be expected, to say the least.

Sadly, the increasing food prices and availability issues we see today are only a tease of what is ahead.

Build that garden.

      <description>Planting delays around the US:  Iowa

Iowa’s spring planting season continues to be delayed, now falling well behind recent years and the five-year average after several rounds of heavy rain and severe weather prevented many from getting into the fields over the warmer weekend.

Average 4-inch soil temperatures remain below the 50-degree target to begin planting corn in Northern Iowa, and while southern and southeast Iowa have finally warmed up, planting is only just getting underway.

Monday’s crop progress report from the USDA didn’t even put a percentage on amount of acres planted through April 24th. For comparison, in 2021, 20 percent of Iowa’s corn crop was already in the ground at this point, with 27 percent in the ground in North Central Iowa, where soil temperatures and growing degree days are well short of targets. Even more starkly, even last year’s 20 percent progress still fell a day behind the 5-year average.

Now, as the calendar is set to turn to May, more rain in the forecast could continue to frustrate farmers, even in areas where ground temperatures have finally hit acceptable levels. Showers and storms on Saturday could bring another soaking rain with widespread totals potentially at an inch or more, with even more rain and storms possible in the long term, arriving Tuesday or Wednesday next week.

      <description>Planting delays around the US: Illinois

RAIN CONTINUES TO DELAY PLANTING

While eighty-degree temperatures over the weekend warmed up southern Illinois soils, frequent rains are still causing planting delays.

For some farmers in the region, including Lance Panzer of Waltonville, the answer to how much planting they have done is, “None whatsoever.”

He tells Brownfield their tillage equipment and planters are hooked up and ready to roll, but “Just about the time we are ready to go, every five days it seems to rain again and that’s how it has been all spring. And every time it rains you can reset the clock another 7 days.”

He says they really need seven days without rain before soils are dry enough for planting, and looking at data from his on-farm trials, he will be concerned if they cannot get some seed in the ground by May 10th.

“After we get past the 10th of May, we are shaving yield off of both beans and corn.”

      <description>Planting delays around the US:  Wisconsin

Freeze warnings in southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois might delay planting for farmers, gardeners

“Planting corn seeds won’t begin until May, but the cold weather might push it back if this weather continues,” said Jordan Schuler, the regional crops educator with UW Extension. Schuler’s region includes Rock and Jefferson counties in Wisconsin.

“I was told that the soil temperature is around 48 degrees, and farmers like it to be around 50 to 55 degrees,” Cain said. “The seeds won’t germinate until the soil gets warm enough.”

      <description>Lab-grown meat and insects 'good for planet and health'

The BBC not even bothering to decorate the propaganda, echoing nearly verbatum the the EAT-Lancet commission. “Food is the single strongest lever to optimize human health and environmental sustainability on Earth.”

__

Dining on the likes of lab-grown meat or ground-up insects could lead to big savings in carbon emissions and water, as well as freeing up land for nature.

Scientists say pressures on the planet could fall by more than 80% with such foods, compared with the typical European diet.

They say switching meat, dairy and other animal products for alternative foods could reduce these impacts by more than 80%, while providing a more complete range of essential nutrients than a purely vegetarian or vegan diet.

      <description>Food producers, up the supply chain, are unable to get ingredients, and forced to change formulations (recipes) frequently:

IAF: Yes, yes, I know only sheeple eat processed foods — but it is insightful to see how these large commpanies are scrabling to manage perception and keep consumers asleep:

Cheerios, Betty Crocker, and Pillsbury's Parent Company Is Changing Its Ingredients

Materials including starch, packaging, fats, and oils were the most challenging for General Mills to find, affecting the multinational brand's pizza, hot snacks, cereal, and refrigerated baked goods.  Part of the issue is a global supply shortage resulting from the war in Ukraine, which has put additional strain on oils and starch. Those two ingredients are usually made of wheat—which is heavily exported by Russia and Ukraine. Both countries are halting sending resources out right now.

      <description>BREAKING: Massive fire engulfs large sausage factory in UK, somehow already 95% burned by time crew arrived.

IAF comment:  these fires are now at ridiculous levels.  Our food supply is spontaneously combusting at ludicrous speed.

By that I mean this:  it is now reaching a level of “Revelation of the Method,” where even Tucker is speaking about the destruction of our food supply, yet multiple large facilities continue to erupt in flames every day.

It is unbelievable, like the poorly constructed narratives of many false flags, such as paper passports being magically found after 9/11…

The fires become an outright mockery of those of us who are paying attention.  We are burning your food supply, and even telling you we're doing it, and you can't stop us!

——  Ignore the mockery -- keep planting that garden. ——


“A large fire at a sausage factory is being tackled by 10 crews from both Essex and Hertfordshire. Thick plumes of smoke can be seen across the town and the fire service has warned people to stay indoors and keep windows shut.

The fire service said when crews arrived the building was 95% alight and 100% smoke-logged.
