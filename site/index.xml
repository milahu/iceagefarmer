      <description>Power down? Try salt curing for a low-electricity alternative

Power cuts, rationing or sky-high energy prices? Who knows what this season will hold. Cooking without power may sound apocalyptic, but there are plenty of ways to get creative in the kitchen, all while keeping electricity use to a minimum.

One alternative is to cure food with salt.

From a chemical point of view, salt also has hygroscopic properties. When in contact with moist food, salt has the ability to absorb the water contained in the food. And it is this phenomenon that is interesting to note when it comes to cutting power use.

      <description>The BASF keystone:  as goes the gas, so goes BASF, so goes Germany, so goes Europe . . .

"Everything is connected at the German chemical firm BASF‚Äôs Ludwigshafen site, a 10 sq km industrial complex so large that byproducts from making ammonia, for example, are funnelled through a 1,771-mile pipe network to produce fertiliser, disinfectant, diesel exhaust fluid, or CO2 for fizzy drinks.

The plant is a giant integrated process ‚Äî and it cannot run without a supply of natural gas.

‚ÄúOnce we can receive &lt; 50% of our maximum requirements, we would need to wind down the entire site,‚Äù says a  spokesperson.

The consequences of a BASF shutdown would be far-reaching, not just in Germany but the entire continent.

BASF-produced chemicals are used to make anything from toothpaste to vitamins, [and animal feed]. It's a top manufacturer of painkillers, and its largest customer industry is the automobile industry [‚Äî and AdBlue, which is required to run diesel engines, and keep trucking running ... ].

      <description>The media is now blaming an outbreak of varroa mites for food prices in Australia.

( by the way there are natural solutions for varroa - see @iaf_bees for beekeeper chat ! )

AUS: Varroa mite to impact grocery prices

Over 12,000 honeybee hives have been destroyed since the mite was detected at the Port of Newcastle in June.

The first 100 days of the outbreak have already cost the economy over $63 million.

      <description>Top notch interview with Gabe Brown on regenerative methods to cultivate awesome soil which can't help but grow amazing amounts of food for your family!

‚Äî‚Äî

Gabe Brown on Regenerative Solutions to Modern Problems ‚Äì Ice Age Farmer Podcast

Gabe Brown of Browns Ranch ‚Äî a pioneer of the soil-health movement and regenerative practices ‚Äî joins Christian to discuss regenerative practices and soil health as the bottom line solutions to the myriad problems we face. We discuss the Covid19 pandemic and what we can learn from it, how healthy living soil helped Brown‚Äôs Ranch weather the difficult, cold and wet 2019 season in North Dakota ‚Äî and can do the same for you! Producers from homesteaders/gardeners to larger farmer ranchers can start improving their operations immediately without huge capital investment. Gabe also describes how they have actually been getting a boost in sales due to their direct-to-market approach. And of course we describe the 6 rules for building amazing soil and growing lots of food!

      <description>"Protein from CO2" is not just technocratic rhetoric babble.  It is highly funded:

We've created the world's first air chicken and air scallops. Turning elements in the air into sustainable protein that eliminates compromise between taste, nutrition, and climate threat.
We're on track to craft our protein flour into delicious and nutritious chicken, beef, pork, and seafood made from air that are better for the planet and your plate.

      <description>"Not all food will be available in the future."

Swedish 'food expert' describes the "Food Transformation" we are living through using the same language as the WEF / EAT/Lancet / UN:

"The most central thing in human life, food, is undergoing a huge transformation right now and thinking about what will be on our plates and how it got there is exciting to say the least.

..."Alternative proteins such as insects, lab-grown meat and new technologies such as producing proteins from carbon dioxide and water will be a complement on our plates in 18 years but not be the main source of protein. "

      <description>More food infrastructure burning - Canadian bridge causes grains transport issues:

‚ÄúAn entire economy is relying on these little ribbons of steel through Canada'

A bridge burned down on the Canadian National Railway Co. line, about 95 kilometres to the south, severing the only rail link in or out of Grande Prairie and causing backlogs for the grain shippers who depend on that track to get their product to port.

CN said the severed line only moves a fraction of the total grain coming off fields in Western Canada. But for grain farmers and exporters, the bridge fire was another example of the fragility of the national supply lines that connect one of the world‚Äôs most important bread baskets with seaports and global markets.

Welcome to the WEF's "post animal economy":

"A new animal-free milk promising to be more sustainable than dairy but with near-identical taste and nutritional content could hit supermarket shelves in the next two years, adding to the growing roster of milk alternatives available to Australian consumers."

Have you been DOOMSCROLLING ‚Äî or are you ACTIVELY investing in a de-centralized future: seed saving (food production), networking (community), energy systems (minimally solar+inverter+hot plate to cook!)

Lots to do - use these moments wisely!

      <description>Force majeure declarations have begun due to barges stopped in Mississippi due to low water levels

This affects not just the grains harvest, but fertilizer applications.

A logjam of ships, tugboats and barges due to low water levels on the Mississippi River is threatening to grind trade of grains, fertilizer and other goods to a halt, Bloomberg reports. Ingram Barge Company, the largest U.S. barge operator, declared force majeure in a letter to customers due to ‚Äúnear-historic‚Äù low water conditions on the Mississippi River. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Coast Guard said there was a queue of 122 vessels at Stack Island and 15 vessels at Memphis. Due to increased groundings, the number of vessels in tow is being restricted.

      <description>Unbelievable - Terrible timing to not be able to export grains/oilseeds:

U.S. barge backlog swells on parched Mississippi River

Commercial barge traffic on southern stretches of the Mississippi River was at a standstill on Tuesday as low water levels halted shipments of grain, fertilizer and other commodities on the critical waterway, shipping sources said.

The supply chain snarl comes just as harvesting of corn and soybeans, the largest U.S. cash crops, is ramping up and as tight global supplies and strong demand for food and fuel have sent inflation soaring.

Around 100 tow boats hauling some 1,600 barges were lined up for miles waiting to pass through one trouble spot near Lake Providence, Louisiana, that has been largely closed since late last week, shipping sources said.

At least two other sections of the lower Mississippi have also been closed at times, disrupting the flow of grain to U.S. Gulf Coast export terminals, where some 60% of U.S. corn, soybean and wheat exports exit the country, they said.

Shippers have been loading less cargo per barge so vessels sit higher on the water, and towing companies have reduced the number of barges per tow by nearly 40% as the low water conditions narrowed the navigable channel.

      <description>Dolphins, skunks, foxes now apparently have #BirdFlu as well ‚Äî Remember : the agenda is ‚Äúanimals are dirty and dangerous and we must separate MAN from NATURE into the SmartCities!‚Äù

In Maine, an elevated number of gray and harbor seal deaths have been attributed to the disease, while in Florida, officials believe a bottle-nosed dolphin succumbed to the virus. It's also been detected in skunks and foxes.

After proliferating globally, a historic wave of avian flu has entered Southern California, where it is worrying farmers and bird lovers and could add to complications with supply chains and food prices.

In late August, one New Jersey park had to close its trails to hikers. There were too many dead vultures on the ground.

Rats fed GM yeast-derived protein soy leghemoglobin ‚Äì the Impossible Burger‚Äôs key ingredient ‚Äì showed signs of toxicity.

If you recall, the FDA at first hesitated about this GMO "heme" to make the Gates-funded thing "bleed," but when Whole Foods was purchased by Bezos, they sold it without FDA approval. The FDA approved soon thereafter.

      <description>Brazilian soybean processors have halted operations as crushing margins turned negative.

Abiove, a trade group representing global oilseed crushers in Brazil, confirmed the move, telling Reuters some of its members advanced scheduled maintenance stoppages that traditionally happen at the end of the year as soyoil prices dropped while soybean prices remained high, hurting margins.

      <description>Vegetable/legume company HAK STOPS production for 6 weeks starting 2023. Energy prices make it infeasible to produce, says the market leader best known for the glass jars of applesauce, peas and brown beans.

"It is not only the high price, but also the uncertainty, says director Timo Hoogeboom. "Today it is two euros for a cubic meter of gas, it used to be three euros. We don't know what it will be in January or February. So to be on the safe side, we will remain closed."

If it is no longer possible to pass on the higher energy prices to consumers, the availability of products may ultimately also be compromised. "If companies have to sell below cost for months, things go wrong." He does not expect any empty shelves for HAK for the time being. "But I don't rule it out for the chain, especially in January, February and March." A temporary energy ceiling for companies could help, the HAK director thinks.

"Companies will first look at how they can absorb the costs themselves, but if that is no longer possible, they will have to scale down," confirms food economist Morren. "I expect this to happen more widely."

      <description>Netherlands: greenhouses and growers increasingly shutting down operations due to energy prices.  Those greenhouses accounted for nearly 40% of veg in Europe...

Video opens with a business owner heating her store with candles/terracotta:  "I lost my customers with COVID, and now inflation is so high people don't have money to buy children's clothes."

The elderly person with candle/terracotta heater is, to me, iconic of the strangulation that is gripping Europe in this engineered energy crisis.

      <description>French refinery strikes takes half of the nation‚Äôs refining capacity offline - forcing France‚Äôs largest sugar maker, Tereos, to curtail production

Diesel and petrol stations in France are running out of fuel, according to an industry union, as a refining strike takes its toll. The strike, which among others, took Total‚Äôs 240,000 bpd Gonfreville refinery offline as well as a couple of Exxon‚Äôs, was expected to conclude on Thursday‚Ä¶but Friday, reports came in that strikes were disrupting Total‚Äôs oil products refining and delivery for a fourth day ‚Äî 60% of the nation‚Äôs total refining capacity.

‚ÄúThere is no need to rush to the station (for gas),‚Äù TotalEnergies said on Friday. Despite those affirmations, France‚Äôs largest sugar maker, Tereos, said it had to curtail production somewhat at some of its factories after Total advised it that it would not be able to supply it with any more diesel until the end of the week.

France was already battling a shortage of refined products, with Russia‚Äôs exports to Europe ‚Äúfalling‚Äù in recent months.

      <description>Bernese farmer‚Äôs 20 cows provide electricity and heat for several houses -- via biogas

Niklaus Hari converts manure and urine from his 20 cows into energy via a small biogas plant, providing electricity AND HEAT for several houses and a development.  ‚ÄúThe main thing,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúis we need the cows for their [manure].‚Äù

This is ANOTHER reason the WEF is so eager to reach the ‚ÄúPost Animal Economy‚Äù ‚Äî only takes a small number of livestock to provide meat, dairy, and manure for fertilizer and energy.

To take control over FOOD, FERTILIZER, and ENERGY, they must eliminate animals from homesteads.

      <description>Hurricane Ian's damage to Florida fertilizer plant creates 'concern' about rising food prices

Hurricane Ian forced Florida fertilizer maker Mosaic Co. to halt operations across Polk County for an unspecified amount of time as disaster relief efforts get underway.

The company‚Äôs North American phosphate operations make up "approximately 50 percent of North American farmers‚Äô supply of granular phosphate fertilizer, and 12 percent of the global supply" in a given year.

      <description>Hurricane Ian is poised to strike at the nation‚Äôs production of phosphate fertilizer, threatening supply as the cost of growing food in the US rises by the most ever.

‚ÄúFlorida is home to Mosaic Co.‚Äôs phosphate rock assets, where they mine product, and to facilities where they turn that rock into fertilizers like diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate, commonly known as DAP and MAP.

‚ÄúMosaic‚Äôs New Wales plant is ‚Äòright in the middle of the damage swath,‚Äô said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. It could ‚Äòbe out for weeks,‚Äô he said in an email.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are significant supply gaps in the daily food supply for people in Germany. The situation is more than serious,‚Äù an open letter from the industry said.

‚ÄúCompanies now fear that production lines will soon come to a standstill and that refrigerated logistics centers for food distribution will be closed. Some are even preparing for possible insolvency.‚Äù

      <description>USDA investing $2.8 billion in ‚Äòclimate-smart‚Äô agriculture

The rhetoric:
‚ÄúThere is strong and growing interest in the private sector and among consumers for food that is grown in a climate-friendly way‚Äù

The reality:
Riceland Foods is one of the company‚Äôs receiving funding. $20 million from the USDA to create a farmer-friendly [üòÇ] system to support adoption of climate-smart practices and interact with commodity buyers in climate-smart markets.‚Äù

BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
‚ÄúRiceland will build a farmer-focused asset registry system for data collection, benefit quantification, verification and farmer compensation.‚Äù

SO IT‚ÄôS A TRACKING SYSTEM‚Äîperfect awareness of all resources. Agenda 2030 style. Just slap ‚Äúfarmer friendly‚Äù and ‚Äúclimate smart‚Äù on it instead of calling it what it is: total surveillance of food production.

USDA conducting #WarOnFarms.

      <description>France to reap worst corn harvest in decades

French farmers are harvesting their smallest corn crop in more than three decades, following the worst drought in at least 500 years that has hit the continent.

The smaller crops in France, which is one of Europe‚Äôs agricultural heavyweights, could drive soaring food prices even higher. Fields in Germany and Romania, other key EU producers, have also suffered from drought.

(Cue the media blaming climate change and calls for zero carbon)

      <description>Europe‚Äôs Natural Gas Shortage Could Trigger A Food Crisis

Governments are using every tool in their kits to curb the rising inflation rates, there‚Äôs far less they can do about the coming food shortage.

"Countries can't mandate fertilizer production because they are so worried about having enough natural gas to heat people's homes," John Harpole, a natural gas broker for the fertilizer sector told Newsweek. "They are having to choose between future food production and heat and they are going to choose heat."

The problem with an energy crisis is that it‚Äôs actually an everything crisis. In a world where virtually every industry relies on energy in some form, runaway inflation is an inevitability.

      <description>France bracing for ‚Äòcatastrophic‚Äô food shortages and price hikes following drought, farmers and unions warn

After four severe heatwaves this year record high temperatures have wreaked havoc on crops and could have a devastating impact on the availability of food across the rest of Europe.

France is the leading European exporter of potatoes with more than two million tonnes of the crop being exported each year.

Food producers say nearly 1.5 million tonnes of potato crops could be lost due to the heatwave ‚Äî a drop of 20 per cent.

Geoffroy d‚ÄôEvry, a farmer in the Oise region and president of potato-growers‚Äô union UNPT, said: ‚ÄúWe have never experienced a situation like this.

‚ÄúWe were preparing to spend the winter without heating or electricity, and now we discover that there may not even be potatoes for dinner?‚Äù  [Welcome to the Great Reset ‚Äî this is why we prepared.]

The Legumes de France federation has also estimated losses of between 25 and 35 per cent of the production and yield of vegetables.

      <description>Russia promises to provide FREE fertilizer and increased grain exports to ‚Äúpoor countries‚Äù ‚Äî this has been under- [un-] reported in western media:
_

Russia is set to ramp up grain exports, seeking to supply some 30 million tons this year, President Vladimir Putin has announced. The supplies will prioritize less well off and food-insecure nations.

‚ÄúWe believe it to be right to ramp up deliveries to the poorest countries,‚Äù Putin said during a meeting of the Security Council on Friday.

‚ÄúIn total, by the end of this year, we will supply some 30 million tons of grain and are ready to increase this volume to 50 million tons or more, because, thank God, we have a good harvest this year,‚Äù he added.

Moscow is also ready to supply fertilizers to the poorest nations free of charge, the Russian president said. ‚ÄúOur producers ‚Äî we‚Äôre talking about potash fertilizers ‚Äì are ready to deliver them free of charge to developing nations that urgently need them,‚Äù Putin said, instructing the Russian Foreign Ministry to work on the plan.

An outbreak of bird flu that has led to the deaths of 43 million chickens and turkeys this year across the U.S. has been found at a giant egg-laying operation in Ohio, state and federal agriculture officials said Wednesday.

The case confirmed over the weekend in Ohio‚Äôs Defiance County has affected roughly 3 million chickens, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The egg-laying farm has started euthanizing all of its flock, said Dennis Summers, the state‚Äôs veterinarian.

India has banned sending broken rice abroad and imposed a 20% duty on other varieties.

The South Asian nation cited food security concerns in making the move, which was announced on Thursday, as below-average monsoon rainfall had curtailed planting. India exports rice to more than 150 countries.

UN Food Official Warns Fertilizer Affordability Crisis Could Slash Global Grain Production By 40%

Global fertilizer shortages threaten to starve a planet as prices are too high for some farmers ahead of the next planting season.¬†

That's the view of Maximo Torero, chief economist from the Food &amp; Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), who told Bloomberg TV that elevated fertilizer prices could decrease global grain production by upwards of 40% in the next planting season.¬†

      <description>Philippines government plans to CONFISCATE sugar and onions.

@iceagefarmer comment: I‚Äôve mentioned so frequently that as net exporters move to protect their domestic stocks/prices, net importers are left empty handed ‚Äî like Philippines here, resorting to confiscation of foodstuffs from private hands.

Sadly, we‚Äôll see more of this in the days ahead.

      <description>Sugar and Salt Shortage Worsens Philippines Food Supply Woes

A top soft-drinks maker with no sugar, a burger joint out of onions and kitchens short of salt underscore the dependence of the Philippines on food imports and illustrate some of the cost  pressures fueling inflation.

The country not only buys sugar, salt and garlic from abroad, but also imports a raft of other food commodities such as rice, wheat, corn and soybean meal, and that‚Äôs after global farm prices surged to a record this year on the back of lower world supply caused by drought, heat and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. ¬†

      <description>Biden/Trump have now mutually declared each other enemies of the state, within just the last days.

The stage is now set, and an extraordinarily dangerous show is about to begin. The USA likes to do things bigger and better, and this will be no exception.  Once this kicks off there will be no stopping it, and I expect escalation of crises and conflicts worldwide.

Keep your wits about you and continue moving away from the system, towards self-sufficiency in food, energy, medicine, local markets/currencies. Radical and rapid decentralization is the only way forward.

Comms will go down at some point.  I am grateful and honored to have shared this space with you.

Godspeed and God bless.

That would be the majority of their productive output. It‚Äôs pretty staggering when you think about it. This is a crash, not a soft landing.

      <description>The USDA has stopped providing export data.

They declined to indicate why.

They neglected to provide a timeline for when this may be available again.

Regardless of the presumably forthcoming excuse, this is effectively an act of warfare as markets (domestic AND foreign) are now blind to what is going/coming from the US.

UPDATE: they now indicate there is an issue migrating to a new reporting system that should be resolved by mid september.  Interesting date given futures contracts‚Ä¶

      <description>Fire at Biggest US Midwest Refinery Threatens Fuel Supplies

An outage at the largest US Midwest refinery is raising wholesale fuel prices regionally just as the agricultural sector gears up for its busiest time of year.

BP shut two crude units at its 435,000 barrel-a-day Whiting, Indiana, refinery after a fire Wednesday, Wood Mackenzie‚Äôs Genscape said. The fire occurred in the power house and caused a loss of cooling water, which could lead to damaged equipment, according to a person familiar with operations.

*** A prolonged shutdown of the plant, which supplies gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to most of the region‚Äôs major distribution centers, could tighten fuel markets just as farmers in the nation‚Äôs breadbasket prepare for harvesting season. ***

@iceagefarmer note: just another coincidence I‚Äôm sure.  Nothing to see here‚Ä¶

      <description>Even more concerning than 50% crop loss, is that farmers are already blowing through their winter animal feed.  Clearly this means that by mid-winter, there will be no animal feed.  Which means come late winter, unless things change somehow, there will be no livestock.

"To make matters worse, livestock farmers in the region are also now struggling, with many being forced to give animals feed meant to be kept for the winter as the amount of edible grass on the ground quite literally has dried up.

"Fodder that might otherwise be imported from Russia or Ukraine is proving hard to come by as a result of the former‚Äôs invasion the latter and the West‚Äôs resulting sanctions war with Moscow..."

      <description>Germany:  50% crop loss due to drought in some regions

Up to half of the crops in parts of the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg are likely to be lost due to drought, farmers in the region have claimed, with problems to do with the prices of fuel, fertiliser, and pesticides connected to the green agenda and war in Ukraine also reportedly causing problems for those in the region

The serious lack of rainfall has led farmers to fear that the likes of maize, sugar beet, potato, and soybean crops could see losses of up to 50%.

      <description>POLAND: People are sleeping in their car just to stay in line for coal to heat their homes.

We can joke, "Thanks a lot Greta" but this is a serious situation and the complete collapse of Europe.  I can't believe that people aren't more upset with EU leadership at the self-imposed, utter destruction of energy supply, food supply, economy, livelihoods.  Perhaps once more people FEEL the pain this winter, we enter Klaus Schwab's "angrier world..."

      <description>India has banned wheat exports to protect domestic prices.

Here's why this is a really big deal as we enter full on #FoodWars.  Top wheat producers are being hit across the board:

#1  China.  (also #1 consumer!)
#2  India.  (and now exports are banned.)
#3  Russia (#1 exporter ‚Äî but Black Sea shipping is affected, and sanctions stop some buyers)
#4  USA (terrible season, drought)
#5  France (drought has severely impacted yields)
#6  Canada (spotty harvest so far)
#7  Germany (drought  has severely impacted yields)
#10 Ukraine

It is these nations that the rest of the world upon for their bread.  And bear in mind some major wheat exporters like Kazakhstan have banned wheat/flour exports.  Supplies are getting tight and countries are acting defensively.  No relief in sight as harvests are looking bad across Northern hemisphere and things are off to poor start in S. America.

Stock up and keep growing food!

      <description>More pushback, not just from farmers but now from Saskatchewan officials:

Saskatchewan warns Trudeau‚Äôs federal Nitrogen agents could be arrested

Saskatchewan Minister Jeremy Cockrill has sent a warning to the Trudeau government that officers sent by Ottawa will be arrested if they continue to trespass on farmland to test nitrogen levels.

According to Cockrill, Trudeau‚Äôs government has been unlawfully sending federal employees onto Saskatchewan farmlands to test for nitrogen levels without the consent of landowners.

In the letter, the Minister raised multiple complaints from Saskatchewan farmers that raised ‚Äúserious concerns about Government of Canada employees, in clearly marked Government of Canada vehicles, trespassing on private lands.‚Äù The farmers reporting these trespasses made clear that these government agents did not request permission to access the land and were not in any other manner given consent to access it.

What is more concerning to some than the actual trespass are the motivations of the federal agents. According to the land owners who confronted the federal agents trespassing on their land, they were told that the purpose of them being there was to test the water in the farmers‚Äô dugouts to measure nitrate levels.

      <description>The losses are catastrophic in every direction.  Italy:  extreme drought

Massimo Saronni walks across his rice field, each step a loud crunch. This field should be flooded with water, flourishing with four-foot emerald green blades and golden rice panicles. Instead, the plants have taken on a yellow-brown tinge and the soil has hardened from lack of rain. Small patches of survivors dot the field, but they only reach his ankle.

‚ÄúThese crops are seriously damaged. They haven‚Äôt had water, so they‚Äôre not going to make it,‚Äù says Saronni, who has worked as a rice farmer for over 30 years. He cultivates different rice varieties, including carnaroli, a high-starch rice prized in Italian cuisine for the creamy risotto it makes.

Northern Italy is suffering from spiking temperatures and its worst drought in more than 70 years.

Italy is the biggest producer of rice in the European Union‚Äîaccounting for over half of its total production‚Äîand importers of Italian rice will surely feel the pinch.

But now 2.2 million hectares of crops are dead due to drought.

This is a deliberate destruction of food supply to usher in complete control.

      <description>Mass crop failures expected in England

Half of the potato crop is expected to fail as it cannot be irrigated, and even crops that are usually drought-tolerant, such as maize, have been failing.

The group was told ‚Äúirrigation options are diminishing with reservoirs being emptied fast‚Äù, and losses of 10-50% are expected for crops including carrots, onions, sugar beet, apples and hops. Milk production is also down nationally because of a lack of food for cows, and wildfires are putting large areas of farmland at risk.

Next few posts will show yields suffering, particularly US, EU, and China.

Europe‚Äôs Drought May Be Continent‚Äôs Worst in at Least 500 Years

Some 64% of the EU is under a drought warning or alert, according to a new report from the European Drought Observatory. The bloc‚Äôs experts said they expect the warm and dry conditions, which are fueling wildfires and reducing crop outputs, to continue in parts of the region until November.

‚ÄúThe combination of a severe drought and heat waves has created an unprecedented stress on water levels in the entire EU,‚Äù Mariya Gabriel, the bloc‚Äôs commissioner for research, said Tuesday in a statement. ‚ÄúClimate change is undoubtedly more noticeably every year.‚Äù

Several EU crops are being hit particularly hard, with the yield forecasts for grain 16% below the 5-year average, and 15% below it for maize, according to the latest data.

The effects of climate change are becoming more evident every year.

      <description>&lt;60% of U.S. Corn Crop in Good Condition - worst crop in decade

This current rating ties with 2019 for the week's worst corn condition rating since 2012.

Hope you are planting a fall crop in your garden ‚Ä¶ @iaf_garden
