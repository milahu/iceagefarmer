      <description>Friends, I will be on Coast to Coast AM tonight 10-11pm Pacific time with Ian Punnett, driving it home that the systems that fed and ran society are being attacked and systematically dismantled, and it is high time to grow food!

It should be a fun chance to reach a few million radio listeners, drop some solid red pills, but also offer hope!  Not sure if Ian will take calls this time, but see you there!

Tune in 10pm PT!  -&gt;

      <description>PANAMA CITY (AP) — Three weeks of continuous demonstrations and road blockades to protest high fuel and food costs in Panama have begun to cause shortages of some food products, fuel and medicine.

The closures, including of the Pan-American Highway, have forced the national electric company to ration electricity in Darien province, which borders Colombia. Tankers carrying gas to run the power generation plant cannot arrive. Some 7,000 families have been affected by the reduction of electricity to 11 hours daily.

In Panama’s main wholesale market that supplies both supermarkets and individual consumers, there was little foot traffic Wednesday. Display tables usually stacked high with produce had far less on offer. Some vegetables like lettuce and tomatos, in particular, were in short supply.

      <description>It may seem as though all is in disarray and things are simply spiraling out of control.  But I must caution you that underneath that techno-fog of war, a machine continues to operate with great precision and efficiency.

That machine actively works to take land from farmers to construct massive “carbon pipelines” to carry CO2 and inject it deep into the earth to “store it safely out of the atmosphere.”

The machine is taking prime farmland to construct massive solar farms — in the heart of our corn belt in Indiana, Iowa , and Illinois just to pick three examples:

“This will be the last year that Norm Welker and his family harvests corn. But Welker will still be a farmer — he’s going to farm the sun.

“Welker is not alone: He is one of dozens of neighbors who are leasing their land for what will be the largest solar farm in the United States. At 13,000 acres [of prime crop land] it is aptly named the Mammoth Solar project and is a partnership between state of Indiana &amp; Israeli-based Doral Renewables LLC!!!!

These are just a few waves visible across a vast ocean of green agenda shutdowns, regulations, and takeover of farming and ranching.

&gt;&gt; Grow food. Raise animals. Support local farmers — cultivate local food systems! &lt;&lt;

      <description>They are winning the war on meat — protein pipeline shrinking. Are you growing/raising your own?

&gt; USDA’s Cattle Inventory Report is expected to show U.S. cattle herd as of July 1 down 2.1% from year-ago.

The projected 2022 calf crop is expected to have shrunk another 2%.
Beef heifers held back for breeding are expected to be down 3.2% from last year.

      <description>Russia Sends Combine Harvesters to Occupied Regions of Ukraine

Russia has sent combine harvesters from Crimea to two Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine to cover a shortage of equipment needed to bring in the crop, a representative of a Russian-installed local administration said.

The official said the harvesters were needed because "the equipment that was there before had either been dismantled or taken away by the previous owners outside the regions", he said. [IAF: By those who are consistently working to destroy global food production]

Evgeny Balitsky, head of the occupation administration in Zaporizhzhia, said on social media that these combine harvesters were provided by Russia's agriculture ministry.

      <description>Colder temps in Russia cause protein content in wheat to drop - even though the harvest is large, the prices of high-quality wheat are still rising:

__
Poor weather over parts of Russia's main producing regions is likely to mean that the supply of higher protein wheat will remain in relatively tight supply - supporting an increased price gap between quality milling wheats and lower quality grades, trade sources have told Agricensus.

Russia is on course to deliver its biggest ever wheat crop, but higher yields and rains over some of the main Russian producing regions mean the crop currently being harvested is showing more 11.5% or feed grades were harvested so far compared to last year.

The price gap between the 12.5%, 11.5%, and feed wheat grades have been increasing over the last week with a gap of almost $16-17/mt seen between 11.5% and 12.5% grades in coaster-sized CIF Marmara trades last week, but offers on a deep sea port basis have also widened to show the same $17/mt differential.

“The quotas, set well below year-ago export levels, would expand China’s intervention in the market to keep a lid on domestic prices and protect food security while global fertiliser prices are hovering near record highs.”

      <description>Macron announces "Turn off your lights" as it becomes clear Russia will not continue providing gas:

"French President Emmanuel Macron warned his country’s people Thursday to prepare for a total cutoff of Russian natural gas by supporting alternatives, having public lights switched off at night and engaging in a period of nationwide energy “sobriety.”

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and ensuing sanctions have aggravated other factors driving up prices for energy and others goods. With no end in sight for the Ukraine war, Macron said, the French should brace themselves for costs to remain high.

“This war will continue,” he said in a televised interview marking France’s national holiday, Bastille Day. “The summer, early autumn will be very hard.”"

- Italy's Draghi is out
- UK's Boris Johnson is out
- Abe is eliminated in Japan
- Estonia's PM has resigned
- Irish government - no confidence vote
- Dutch protests continue to gain steam — German farmers are joining

Amazing how quickly things are moving.  Expect more as the West continues to be destroyed from within ... (as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt move towards BRICS!)

Also hearing lots of reports of poor germination/yields from seeds from corporate sources (home depot, etc)..

      <description>Obligatory flashback to Putin mocking Europe — "No gas, no coal ... what are you going to do, burn firewood?  You import firewood too!"

The words seem prescient as Hungary just banned exports of firewood, and the EU is panicking.

- Russia hints NordStream 2 is NOT coming back online.
- German banks adjust models to say "We might survive if houses heat using firewood and we STOP all industry and economic activity (really strong plan guys!)
- Hungary announces ban on export of firewood:

      <description>US corn is being BAKED right now, much of it is tasseling, meaning yield will be impacted quite severely.

In other words, Andrey should already be worried about corn.

And about the culling of cattle herds happening now in Texas drought.

Grow your garden folks. Things are getting rough, and accelerating quickly.

      <description>Italian onion harvest starts with lower yield due to drought

The onion harvest in the southern Italian province of Bari is underway and it appears that yields are already declining. "We are now in the middle of the harvest and we are trying to move up a gear to get ahead of any weather change. We needed rain in April and May, not now," said Vito Abrusci, director of the growers' association La Vera Cipolla Rossa di Acquaviva delle Fonti.

      <description>“What happens after they burn down the farms?"

ANSWER:

EU’s Plan to Replace Farms – CITIES2030 – Digital Twin of Food Supply (nov 2021)

As our food supply is systematically dismantled, the EU is funding a project to create “Urban Food Systems” and a blockchain-based “digital twin” platform to track indoor farming and synthetic meat from laboratory to plate to sewers. Is this an organic response to a crisis, or a nefarious plan, generations in the making, being realized before our eyes? Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

      <description>Ghana:  food shortages hit schools as students drink porridge without bread and sugar

There appears to be a serious food shortage in Senior High Schools in the country. This is a result of the poor food supply situation in the schools which is reported to have reached dire and deteriorated levels.

He said the students are given porridge without milk, sugar, and bread adding that "Dear parents, these are our boys, and as a parents association, we have less than GH¢1,000 in our coffers. What can this do?"

The Headmaster of St Augustine's, Henry Arthur-Gyan, also said the school had no option but to manage the situation.  "We know there are challenges and so we manage with what we are provided. There is not much we can do about it," he stated.

[ @iceagefarmer note:  expect media to play up school food shortages as a key concept in the Rockefeller ‘Reset the Table’ agenda is to use schools as “nutritional hubs” for communities ]

      <description>Canada plans a nitrogen policy like the one fueling farmer protests in Netherlands:

This is the destruction of farming and ranching as a hostile takeover of human food production.

“The Government of Canada has set the national fertilizer emissions reduction target of 30%, which is part of the commitment to reduce total GHG emissions in Canada by 40-45% by 2030…”

      <description>Cattle producers struggling with high cost of feed

“Most beef producers in this area have their cattle out on grass now, so they don’t have to buy hay or grain. But it’s going to be a problem in the fall; it’s difficult to make a profit in this business when you have to pay $8 or $9 for a bushel of grain to help these cattle through the cold winters,” Balicki said. “And, you do have to give cattle grain in this part of the world, because they need the energy to keep warm. So that’s a huge concern.”

      <description>UK dairy farmers warn of price rises amid chronic staff shortages

Dairy farmers are warning that a chronic shortage of workers is hitting milk production and further fuelling food price inflation, and are calling for urgent action to stop the situation getting worse.

Eight in 10 farm owners looking for workers said they had received very few or zero applications from people with the right experience or qualifications, in response to a survey by Arla Foods, the UK’s largest dairy co-operative.

- Germany: is restricting when and how energy companies can declare force majeure;

- France: has just nationalized the nation’s largest energy company, EDF;

- UK: announced they, too, would simply cut off natgas to the EU when supply is short;

- The EU has decided that nuclear and natural gas energy are “green” after all, a semantic change which only marginally lengthens the runway for their ‘decarbonization transition’

These are major moves that signal the hard landing ahead — brace for impact, my friends.

      <description>AWFUL:  animal feed shortages reported in the USA as deliveries remain scarce:

”The point has been reached when millions of chickens will be killed and other livestock will suffer because of UP’s [IAF: that is WEF partner Union Pacific] service failures,” Foster Farms wrote in its request to the Surface Transportation Board this week.

Rail bottlenecks in the U.S. are not improving, and in some cases, growing more severe. Feed users in California and the Southwest are having issues sourcing grain, with some reporting they are paying $3 over the CBOT price to secure grain by truck. Not only are feed users on the brink of running out of grain, but there are also concerns the rail issues could grow worse during harvest this fall.

[ plenty of ideas on how to grow your own animal feed in @iaf_birds ! ]

      <description>EXPERTS WARN: MASK UP IN THE GARDEN!

This explosion of cardiac issues? It’s because people started gardening during the pandemic.

Gardening is DIRTY and DANGEROUS and can KILL YOU — you should ONLY eat fake meat and bugs.  NEVER GARDEN.  You will be SAFE inside away from DIRTY animals and DANGEROUS soil.

[These people will stop at nothing to control your food supply!]

__

Urgent warning to gardeners as soil ‘increases risk of killer heart disease’

Medics found that pollutants in the soil could have a 'detrimental effect on the cardiovascular system'.  “Contaminated soil could lead to increasing oxidative stress in the blood vessels, which in turn leads to heart disease.”

Dirty soil can get into the blood stream, through inhalation.

      <description>Unscheduled power outages result in high chicken mortalities - some farmers give up as Incubators run cold, freezers full of product thaw out, and losses mount.

__
Power grid “Load shedding” drops certain zones deemed non-critical — but this is causing farmers to lose their animals!

Deidre Carter, CEO of Agri Limpopo, said one of the organisation’s members had reported losing about 2 000 broiler chickens in a single day due to Eskom’s unilateral load-reduction strategy, while another had decided to leave the poultry industry altogether.

“Load reduction is a lot worse than [rolling blackouts], because one never knows when or how long the power will be out,” she told Farmer’s Weekly.

      <description>"Hot water at night is a luxury that you can no longer afford"

The zero-carbon agenda is cold and miserable.

A housing cooperative near Dresden had announced that it would only provide hot water at certain times. The reason: the high gas prices. Federal Building Minister Geywitz criticized that this was "illegal".The announcement by a Saxon housing cooperative to restrict the hot water supply has met with massive criticism in politics. Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) told the newspapers of the Funke media group: "Simply turning off the hot water temporarily is illegal."

Supermarkets appear to be toughening its security measures on foodstuffs as shoppers feel the financial pinch of soaring inflation

Supermarkets have been spotted adding security tags to basic food items like cheese, as the cost of living crisis sees pricing spiralling.

Britons took to social media to share pictures of tags more commonly used on bottles of alcohol attached to £3.99 blocks of Aldi cheddar.

An official investigation is underway after Dutch police fired live shots at anti-green agenda protesters in the Netherlands.

... Farmers are protesting new policies which "will lead to at least 30% of Dutch farms being put out of business as they’re forced to cut the number of livestock by the same figure."

Anger has intensified after the government revealed the same nitrogen cuts, being proposed in the name of fighting climate change, won’t be applied to the airline industry.

      <description>CO2 shortage threatens New Zealand chicken supplies

Plans are in progress to reduce production of some chicken products, according to the country’s leading poultry meat producer.

Tegel is warning that it may not be able to produce some chicken products because of a shortage of carbon dioxide gas in New Zealand that is also threatening brewers and fizzy drinks makers.

The Food and Grocery Council said the availability of cheese, preserved meats, sparkling wine and ready-to-eat meals could also suffer, with price rises possible.

The Brewers Association and the Beverage Council separately voiced concerns about the gas shortage on Saturday.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is used widely in the food industry – including in packaging to preserve the shelf life of chicken – and to add fizz to drinks, as well as in other industries such as healthcare.

Businesses used to get much of their CO2 supply from the Marsden Point oil refinery, which produced CO2 as a by-product of its refining operation until that was replaced in favor of importing energy.

      <description>Libya declares force majeure on oil exports after weeks of protests and port blockades.

This is major news on its own, but also needs to be considered from Europe's perspective:

- 6% of EU oil &amp; gas imports are from Libya and were just taken off the table.
- 34% of EU oil and 55% of gas comes from Russia, which is being throttled
- Freeport terminal in TX was blown up and cannot send LNG
- UK just announced they'd stop gas exports to EU if there were shortages
- EU and UK are both frantically burning gas just to generate electricity now, instead of storing for the winter ahead!

- Greenhouses, food plants and facilities are ALREADY SHUT DOWN due to the cost of energy — and somehow things keep blowing up!  This is an absolute CONTROLLED DEMOLITION.

Europe is being strangled !!

People with COVID-19 can infect and sicken cats and dogs by cuddling them, says study

The study said that while it was already known that animals including cats, dogs, ferrets and hamsters seem to be susceptible to COVID-19, transmission may be happening more often than previously thought.

"These data indicate relatively common transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to animals and that certain human-animal contacts — example, kissing the pet, pet sleeping on the bed — appear to increase the risk," said the study.

Transmission from humans to animals can be minimized by owners keeping their distance, wearing a mask and taking other precautions, just as they would to prevent infecting a person, he said.

      <description>No Russian Gas -&gt; No Eggs!  Farmers warn an energy crisis is ALSO a FOOD CRISIS.

Without natural gas supplies, there are immediate animal welfare problems on the farms. From the hatchery to the barn to the slaughterhouse, all companies in the poultry industry are dependent on the energy source.  [IAF:  and thus, these are being shut down by design.]

Short-term energy restrictions would have "an immediate impact on the food security of the residents".

The poultry industry is energy-intensive. "For the Lower Saxony poultry industry alone, including the production of poultry feed [!!!] we have calculated an annual gas requirement of around 1,735,311 megawatt hours."

      <description>Ukraine: gain exports plummet 44% year over year:

Ukraine exported 1.11 million tonnes of grain in the first 22 days of June, down 44% from the same period in 2021, Reuters reported, citing agriculture ministry data released June 27.

The volumes included 978,000 tonnes of corn, 104,000 tonnes of wheat and 24,000 tonnes of barley, the data showed. Ukraine exported up to 6 million tonnes of grain a month before Russia launched an invasion on Feb. 24.

Ukraine is among the world’s largest exporters of wheat and corn. Exporters are struggling to get what’s left in storage out of the country, because Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea, like the key city of Odessa, are under blockade by Russia.

      <description>Possible foot and mouth disease case investigated at pig farm in Norfolk (UK)

A possible outbreak of foot and mouth disease is being investigated at a Norfolk pig farm - sparking major worries for the region's livestock industry.

Defra has enforced a 10km Temporary Control Zone for foot and mouth disease at a farm between Feltwell and Brandon.

The precautionary measure was put in place at 10pm on Thursday "following suspicion of vesicular disease in pigs".

      <description>BOOM ! Suddenly it's YOUR backyard chickens that are causing pandemics, not industrial agriculture.  This was the plan all along to take total control over food production!

 &gt; "If we can’t dramatically cut meat consumption then intensive ‘factory farming’ may be comparatively less risky" because “non-intensive” or “low-yield” farms [IAF: ie. anyone producing their own food other than large industrial technocrat owned operations] pose a serious risk to human health as they need far more land to produce the same amount of food [this is also a lie!].

"This, it is argued, increases the chances of “spillover” of dangerous viruses between animals and humans because it drives habitat loss, which displaces disease-carrying wild animals such as bats and rodents and brings them into closer contact with farmed animals and humans."

... and this builds on that weird Fauci paper blaming all pandemics on humans interacting with nature — the goal is to divorce man from God's creation. #transhumanism

      <description>“Unprecedented” Summer Snow Hits Afghanistan; Similarly In India And Pakistan, Rare Mid-June Freeze Delivers Heavy Snowfall; + Unusual Cold Sweeps Namibia

Unprecedented and heavy snowfall has struck central Afghanistan which, at this time of the year, poses a threat to young livestock and tender crops.

Residents in various towns and villages of Bamyan province have reported snow down to an unusually low elevation, even as the calendar reads summer — unprecedented in at least the last 20 years.

      <description>AUS: Fruit and vegetable costs to skyrocket in coming weeks

Aussies are being warned the price of all fruit and vegetables will spike in coming weeks as farmers face labor shortages and growing production costs.

Tyson Cattle, from the national industry representative AusVeg, told Today the issues were critical and "impacting grower confidence to plant more crops".

"They're unable to access the pickers and packers needed to actually get crops off the ground and onto supermarket shelves," Tyson told Today.

Some of the signs from the Dutch protest (see previous post) are pretty spot on.  Where is the public support?  People too distracted by media's putin-rhetoric

      <description>Dutch farmers protest government's decision to cut chicken flocks by 30% for "nitrogen savings"

The War on Meat continues...

The Netherlands, the world's second-largest agricultural exporter, is one of the top greenhouse gas emitters in Europe -- especially of nitrogen -- with much of this blamed on cattle-produced manure and fertiliser.

Farmers say they are targeted while big business and industry slide, with many vowing to resist any plans to scale down or close farms.

"It's not normal, what's being done to the farmers," 74-year old protester Jan Poorter told AFP. ""You can't just close farms that are hundreds of years old. You just can't!"

      <description>UN Food Chief Halves Refugee Meal Rations As Global Hunger Crisis Worsens 

Too bad people can’t simply eat half as much…

“On Monday, David Beasley, director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), released a statement detailing "the heartbreaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival."
"As global hunger soars way beyond the resources available to feed all the families who desperately need WFP's help, we are being forced to make the heartbreaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival," Beasley said.

      <description>Iranian schools, hospitals facing food shortages as prices skyrocket

Local media in Iran say public institutions such as hospital, prisons, and child-care centers are facing possible food shortages due to skyrocketing prices.

The Tehran-based Etemad newspaper reported on June 15 that the impending “problem” could hit in “the coming weeks” and that “food supplies will be disrupted not only in hospitals but also in other government facilities such as barracks, prisons, nursing homes, and even student dormitories.”

Etemad quoted the head of a private hospital as saying that a sharp rise in food prices has affected the quality of hospital food to such an extent that freshly made items are likely to be eliminated in public and private hospitals, with packaged foods being used instead.

The head of the hospital, who asked not to be identified, added: “In the coming weeks, it will be impossible for many public or private medical centers to provide hot meals, especially protein-rich foods, to hospitalized patients because this increase in food prices was not seen in any hospital budget.”

Water is so low in large stretches of Italy's largest river that local residents are walking through the middle of the expanse of sand and shipwrecks are resurfacing.

Authorities fear that if it doesn't rain soon, there'll be a serious shortage of water for drinking and irrigation for farmers and local populations across the whole of northern Italy.

      <description>‘Marching towards starvation’: UN warns of hell on earth if Ukraine war goes on

Unprecedented food shortages could spark riots in dozens of countries as Black Sea blockade adds to pressures, says WFP chief

Dozens of countries risk protests, riots and political violence this year as food prices surge around the world, the head of the food-aid branch of the United Nations has warned.

Director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), said the world faced “frightening” shortages that could destabilise countries that depend on wheat exports from Ukraine and Russia.

“Even before the Ukraine crisis, we were facing an unprecedented global food crisis because of Covid and fuel price increases,” said Beasley. “Then, we thought it couldn’t get any worse, but this war has been devastating.”

      <description>World's Largest Cricket protein 'factory' completed in Ontario — "you really will eat ze bugs":

Aspire’s new plant will reportedly produce 9000 metric tons of crickets every year for human and pet consumption.  — about two billion insects to be distributed annually across Canada and throughout the United States.

Aspire also reports that it already has orders for the next two years.

Crickets are currently being explored as a protein-rich superfood. They contain fibre and are already found in grocery stores and restaurants, and have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional protein sources.

      <description>“Shock report” reveals food prices could go up 15% over the summer, squeezing family finances further

“Some families may have to skip meals as inflation continues to rise. The report also mentioned that the UK economy is facing its “strongest period” of inflationary pressure since the 1970s, with the conflict in Ukraine worsening the impact by restricting supply chains and pushing up grain prices.”

UK: Food prices could go up by 15% over the summer, adding to the stress on families facing rising petrol and energy bills. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) said in a report that households are set to pay more for essentials including dairy, bread and meat.

      <description>Stunning footage of thousands (10k+) of dead cattle in Kansas yesterday.

It is reported these cattle died of excessive heat —  while temps were not excessively high, there was also high humidity and no wind.

Others are speculating that this is exceptional even for summer heat, and this is another blatant destructive act perpetrated on our food supply.

What do you think?

      <description>"Could a food shortage be coming?" Record diesel prices are crushing farmers

“I’ve got a tractor hooked up to my corn planter out here, no diesel fuel, and I can’t afford to get any.”

The crushing reality of record diesel fuel prices is pushing farmers to the brink and may affect food availability. &lt;- [READ IT AGAIN]

“We have reached that point to where it is very close to being a sinking ship,” Kotzmoyer, a legislative affairs specialist for the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau, testified to state lawmakers Tuesday. “We are teetering on the edge right now. Food may not be as available because of the fuel price surge."

      <description>Trucker Strike In South Korea Sparks Economic Turmoil, Risks Global Spillover

The epicenter of the next global supply chain snarl could be in South Korea as a nationwide trucker strike broadens and is hindering domestic economic activity, which may spill over to the rest of the world.

Bloomberg reports that the Cargo Truckers Solidarity Union entered its seventh day of strikes on Monday, causing $1.6 billion in disruptions for auto, petrochemical, steel, and other top industries.

      <description>WTO declares 'Polycrisis', requiring global government, as no one country can solve it — a worldwide problem/reaction/solution:

“This polycrisis... is really unprecedented. And what is very central to all of this is that no one country can solve this crisis on its own. This is the time that you need the world working together. You need global solidarity,” she said.

The WTO chief drew attention to export controls, which, as she repeatedly stated, should be eased in order to avoid making an already dire situation worse. [IAF: this was precisely the script from Podesta's 2015 'Food Chain Reaction Game']

So this is the "Global problems require global solutions" narrative now for food shortages, as has also been used with "climate crisis" and covid.

This means that unresolved work contract negotiations between the labor union and the foodservice distributor could result in a strike that may disrupt the flow of food products to tens of thousands of restaurants.

      <description>UN warns of food catastrophe

Without fertilizers, shortages will spread from corn and wheat to all staple crops, including rice, with a devastating impact on billions of people in Asia and South America, too. This year’s food crisis is about lack of access.  Next year’s could be about lack of food,” he added.

Unfortunately, dozens of countries may face a physical shortage of food. Millions of people may starve if Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea continues.

      <description>Bad grains harvest forecast for EU - including France, who is usually exporter

Worsens global outlook for #wheat shortages

"The EU is expected to produce almost 5% less wheat this year compared with 2021. It was also forecast to produce 278.8 million metric tons of all grains in the 2022-2023 growing season, down over 4% from last year, because of the dry weather.

Production in France, which is the fifth-largest grower of wheat in the world, was also projected to decline by more than 5%. The country accounts for about 18% of European agricultural production, according to the French Ministry of Agriculture. France is also the fourth-biggest wheat exporter globally.

In addition to dry weather, the country’s agricultural land has been hit with severe storms, that damaged wheat, fruit and vineyard land.

      <description>"Large supply gaps in turkey will begin Q3." Bird Flu was confirmed in "our supply chain" in March. A top US food processing company warned of an upcoming shortage of its turkey products at supermarkets following one of the worst bird flu outbreaks.

"Our Jennie-O Turkey Store team is facing an uncertain period ahead," Hormel Foods Corporation CEO Jim Snee told investors in an earnings call.

Since the USDA first detected bird flu in the US in mid-February, more than 38 million birds in 35 states have died. Out of that figure, 5 million turkeys in the US have been killed, with most deaths in Minnesota and South Dakota.

“They currently have a proposal underway to deciminate all the Pick your own farms in NSW and want to put unrealistic limitations on the number of visitors per day that attend these farms.  The current proposal they have is to only allow 50 people per day to attend the farms and a maximum of 10 days per year that these farms  are allowed to open for PYO.”
