      <description>France trying desperately to restart nuclear reactors, but labor union strike delaying maintenace!

France generates roughly 70% of its electricity from a nuclear fleet of 56 reactors, all operated by EDF. However, many of them have been closed down for maintenance, some due to corrosion-related issues. Currently, only 31 units are reportedly operating. EDF has pledged to restart all shutdown reactors before winter to avoid power shortages in the country.

However, since October 6, there have been strikes among EDF employees involved in repair work at 19 reactors, delaying maintenance by several weeks.

Last month, the French national electricity grid operator RTE warned that it would not rule out the risk of blackouts this winter due to prolonged strikes halting the repair.

[this announcement, as it is revealed that UK was running drills about managing extended blackouts and resulting crises … it is clear what is planned for the #EnergyCrisis]

      <description>Australia: flooding damages $150 million of wheat alone in NSW

Agronomists say the grain-growing hub of the north-west is expected to have "conservatively" lost more than 120,000 hectares of wheat that was nearly ready to harvest.

The region also boasts large barley and canola outputs and is in the summer planting window for crops such as cotton and sorghum.

“this ongoing wet weather with flood after flood after flood is just unbelievable."

Unbelievable losses, particularly when the world is already short on #wheat and other grains…

“There are many impacted farmers who will be cash poor and without an income as a result of this flooding, and that has caused widespread economic pain across rural areas,"

      <description>Further, search engines have devolved into curated sets of links — this was absolutely openly confirmed by WEF reps working with Google to override results for terms like ‘climate change.’ [video]

With curated search results limiting what an inexperienced user can find, and bots constituting 80% of the tweets on a given topic …

… the internet really is dead.

      <description>The system tried to front-run this with MSM talking points on a “dead internet conspiracy theory” that “feels real.”

It masked the literal deployment armies of bots across Twitter, telegram, any social network, comment section, reddit, /pol , etcetcetc

These bot agents:

- mix in poison pills to SIGINT by, for example, having bots yell “MAGA” or “go putin” in whatever channels they want to shut down.  (Later, big data analytics announce that all homesteading channels are putin supporters.  Seriously, there are Gates-funded organizations doing this, and they intend in the future to use these "associations" to censor any voice)

- Sway public opinion by appealing to basic crowd psychology (recall the ashe conformity experiments)

- annoy real users who are trying to find actual factual data

      <description>MASSIVE ANTI-RUSSIAN ‘BOT ARMY’ -- 80% of TWEETS!!! -- EXPOSED BY AUSTRALIAN RESEARCHERS

An Australian university has unearthed millions of Tweets by fake ‘bot’ accounts pushing disinformation on the Ukraine war.

80 percent of tweets about the 2022 Russia-Ukraine invasion in its early weeks were part of a covert propaganda campaign originating from automated fake ‘bot’ accounts.

IceAgeFarmer note:  this is part of the “cognitive warfare” strategy that NATO openly discussed — next generation social engineering.  See my report here.

      <description>Look at that - US exports record amount of wheat in September (as other countries are stockpiling).

There IS no strategic grain reserve in the US - it was liquidated over a decade ago. Just like they’re draining the SPR now.

3+ mmt, to destinations China, Mexico, Philippines.

USA set up for incomprehensibly massive failure …

      <description>US: Lawmaker warns of impact from diesel shortage, rail strike after election

Wisconsin Rep. Bryan Steil says that the economy could take a dual hit after the election if diesel shortages persist and rail unions strike as promised.

“weeks after President Biden told us that he had this all under control, and the trains would be running on time, We're now learning it's anything but that. It's another game where the Biden administration has kicked the can down the road and kicked it past this election."

Steil said the impact of the railroad strike could be exacerbated by ongoing shortages of diesel fuel, which power everything from tractor trailers to harvesting tractors.

"The shortages that we're seeing around the country is concerning," Steil continued. "But it's all the more concerning that we have policies coming from Biden and from Pelosi that are putting us in this position in the first place."

      <description>Indonesia is stockpiling food RAPIDLY to weather this food crisis.

Is your nation? And if not:  Are you? How is the LOCAL food system in your community?
-
“Under a new presidential regulation, which took effect Oct. 24, Bapanas with the help of state-owned enterprises plans to secure stocks of 11 staple foods, such as rice, corn, soybeans, shallots, chili, sugar for household, cooking oil, as well as some meat and fish.”

Indonesia is striving to reach 1.2 million tonnes of rice reserves by the end of the year, enough to meet 3.9% of domestic demand, as it battles inflation.

"The risk of kept birds being exposed to disease has reached a point where it is now necessary for all birds to be housed until further notice.”

Animals are “dirty and dangerous” narrative sets the tone for end of ranching and forcing people onto fake lab-grown meat:

      <description>WHEAT: even without black sea deal falling apart, current crop is in RECORD WORST condition — and global stocks are already at RECORD LOW.

Then mix in Russia withdrawing from agreement for grain corridor.

Neither does the market have this priced in, nor do many people realize the implications for #FoodPrices and geopolitics…

Engineered food shortages to usher in technocratic control over food and all resources…

      <description>AI can “speak to” animals, experts claim, prompting worries of “manipulating” their behavior:

 • A team of German researchers trained AI to mimic a honeybee's waggle dance 

 • The AI powered a robot inside a hive, which controlled the bees' movements
 
 • The technology can also pick up the low-frequency sound of elephants and decipher clicking made by whales

 • However, experts fear humans could use the technology to manipulate animals

      <description>Fear of global food shortage looms as Russia steps back from Ukraine grain deal

U.S. President Joe Biden warned that global hunger could increase because of Russia’s suspension of a U.N.-brokered deal to allow safe passage for ships carrying Ukrainian grain.

“It’s really outrageous,” said Biden speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday. “There’s no merit to what they’re doing. The UN negotiated that deal and that should be the end of it.”
Biden spoke hours after Russia announced it would immediately halt participation in the agreement, alleging ghat Ukraine staged a drone attack Saturday against Russia’s Black Sea Fleet ships off the coast of occupied Crimea. Ukraine has denied the attack.

      <description>Russia suspends grain deal after this morning’s drone attack on their naval forces.

Also worth noting—because why is no one concerned about this?—that Russia openly accuses UK of involvement in today’s attack, as well as Nordstream sabotage.

Suddenly direct conflict, no longer proxy.

      <description>They REALLY ARE building this SmartCity in the desert - a linear structure 170km long, 500m tall, with mirrored facade, to hold 9 million people.

Hopefully you also REALLY ARE building your own homestead (“It’s 2030, I own a farm and am happy!”) and community.

Because their plans, for a "walled garden" 500mtall, 200m wide, and in between, “densely packed urban fabric alongside trees and plantlife and a high-speed rail network embedded underground.” -- totally suck!

      <description>Tanzania starts rationing water due to drought

[You don't need water EVERY day…]

Tanzanian authorities on Thursday began rationing water in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam following a drought-induced drop in water levels from its main source, the Ruvu river.

The 5.5 million inhabitants of the Indian Ocean city will go without piped water for 24 hours on alternating days, the Dar es Salaam Water and Sanitation Authority (DAWASA) said.

"The timetable will be updated every week according to how the change of weather increases or decreases the water levels," it said.

      <description>With only ~20 days of US supply remaining, Diesel, along with heating oil, aviation fuel and kerosene, headed towards record prices.

“The economy runs on diesel,” said Cinquegrana. “Think of everything you buy in the store, it was brought there by trains and trucks. Construction works, etc. High diesel prices could slow down economic activity. Prices are down from all-time highs in mid-June, but not enough to allay concerns.”

“There’s not a lot that can be done to prepare for very tight diesel supplies, so this is going to be a serious problem. I think the White House is monitoring it, but I don’t see a lot of levers they could pull that could really affect prices because it’s a global issue.”

But you can — and should — get prepared personally.

      <description>US diesel shortage: we’ve been hearing this for months but now suppliers are actually putting out alerts:

—
US diesel shortages are spreading along the East Coast amid a ban on imports from Russia, raising fears of further surges in prices for the fuel as consumers brace for the winter heating season.

Mansfield Energy, one of the nation’s major fuel distributors, instituted emergency measures on Tuesday and warned its customers that carriers were being forced to visit multiple terminals in some cases to find supplies, delaying deliveries.

“In many areas, actual fuel prices are currently 30-80 cents higher than the posted market average because supply is tight,” said Mansfield.

With shortages spreading from the Northeast to the Southeast, the company advised customers to give 72-hour notice for their orders to avoid having to pay above-market prices:

      <description>NET ZERO BANKING

The UN’s “Principles for Responsible Banking” dictate that financial institutions cease lending to “carbon emitting” industries/companies.

About $70 trillion worth of assets under US, UK, German and Swiss banks are founding members, eager to strangulate the societies they serve under the guise of environmentalism.

On the other hand, notably absent from its signitories are most BRICS banks - in China (0 signatories), India (0), Brazil (2), and Russia (only 1).

This is nothing less than an ongoing attack on our financial system. It is the economic equivalent of social engineering.

We need to fully understand and appreciate these attacks on our food and financial systems.  They necessitate a rapid move to de-centralization: community based food systems facilitated by local currencies.

Spread the word, and keep building !

      <description>Nationwide shortages of antibiotic Amoxicillin

… and this just the beginning as 98% of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) come from China… who is gearing up for war. We shut down their semiconductors, they strip our antibiotics.

No one wins.

Good time to check on your herb garden - many plants have antibiotic aspects! @iaf_herbs

Amoxicillin, a commonly used drug for treating bacterial infection, is in short supply. Three of the top four makers of the antibiotics report having supply constraints in the U.S. The liquid form of the drug is taking the biggest hit.

      <description>Persistent drought conditions and high winds are creating dangerous harvest conditions for Missouri farmers.

Missouri farmer Robert Schmidt says there were several combine fires across the state over the weekend, including one near his farm. “The farmer was able to get out some of the crops from the 800 acres that burned. The fire put itself out with the help of the fire department containing it to a wetland area.”

“The best thing we can get is many hours of steady rainfall to soak into the soil profile.” According to the latest U.S. Drought Monitor, all of Missouri is categorized as abnormally dry to exceptional drought, with 14 percent in extreme to exceptional drought.

      <description>U.S. winter wheat farmers plant into dust as Plains drought persists

"It's sort of a grim situation," said Kent Winter, who farms in Andale, Kansas, outside Wichita. He said he normally seeds by mid-October but has yet to plant any.

[ IceAgeFarmer note:  I have never before seen #wheat trending on twitter … ]

The 2023 U.S. hard red winter wheat crop is already being hobbled by drought in the heart of the southern Plains, wheat experts said.

Planting plans may be scaled back in the U.S. breadbasket despite historically high prices for this time of year, reflecting rising global demand and thin world wheat supplies projected to end the 2022/23 marketing year at a six-year low. The tight supplies have been exacerbated as the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted grain exports from the Black Sea region.

The drought threatens Kansas, the top winter wheat growing state, and Oklahoma in two ways: discouraging farmers who have not yet planted from trying, while threatening crops already in the ground from developing properly.

      <description>Empty Shelves as Inflation Leaves Products Unprofitable

“Not only Mars [who worked hand in hand with Rockefeller Foundation on "Reset the Table”], but also Coca Cola [WEF partner] or Procter &amp; Gamble [WEF Partner]  are currently trying to ride the wave of inflation with excessive price demands in order to increase their returns,” a spokesman for the Edaka chain of supermarkets claimed.

The official went on to claim that a number of major companies have now halted deliveries to the chain, something that they alleged is being used to put pressure on supermarkets.

[IceAgeFarmer: the Rockefeller/WEF partners are squeezing you as hard as they can.]

——

Products ranging from Kellogg’s cornflakes to Coca Cola have disappeared from supermarkets throughout Germany, with many shops being left with empty shelves as products become simply unprofitable to sell due to differentials in inflation.

It comes as overall inflation hit 10% in the country in September, with EU-wide inflation for the month falling just short of 11% as a result of the ongoing #EnergyCrisis, which has in turn hiked the cost of food and other essential goods.

Retailers in the country however have strongly resisted this, with one supermarket chain in the country going so far as to accuse major companies of “price gouging” and “usury”.

“The situation in the industry is critical to catastrophic,” Federal Association of the Food Industry general manager Christoph Minhoff remarked regarding the feud, which has seen some individual rows even reportedly ending up in court as companies are unable to come to a compromise.

As a result of these ongoing hostilities between supermarkets and producers, a wide variety of well-known brands have disappeared from supermarkets throughout Germany, leaving many shops with empty shelves.

The likes of Coca Cola, Pepsi, Snickers, Kellogg’s Cornflakes, Milka Chocolate, Ritter Sport chocolate, Wrigley’s chewing gum, along with many other products ranging from mayonnaise to pet food have all been affected, though availability reportedly varies between supermarket chains.

Yara has now closed another European fertilizer plant - due to the cost of energy.

Yara’s site in Wallonia has been offline from 15 September. It is no longer financially viable to make fertiliser in Europe, given that natural gas is key to the process.

They aren’t alone. Steel producers, yarn factories, are all shutting down…

      <description>Undersea cable CUT to Shetland, communications down.

I’d warned once pipelines started blowing up that undersea cables would be the next bit of critical infrastructure to be targeted - here we go.

- Get hard copies of materials you need
- Write down critical radio frequencies for your family/group, nearby repeaters
- Know where and HOW to get information if comms go out

      <description>I have to say… it is interesting that mainstream media has started talking about the Mandela Effect.

Are they trying to convince people that they can’t rely on their memories? Is this the ultimate goal of psyop?

What do you make of it?

      <description>Undersea cables damaged to cut communications ? More predictive media around this from US Naval Institute:

Repairing Submarine Cables Is a Wartime Necessity

Options to repair underseas fiber-optic cables in the event of war or sabotage are limited.

“What should the U.S. do when the transoceanic submarine fiber optic cables that supply, at the speed of light, more than 99 percent of the international voice, data, video, and internet communications between the United States and the rest of the world are damaged or cut during wartime?

Declare an emergency? Then what?”

      <description>“Many agrifood sectors are now  controlled by just four to six dominant firms, enabling these companies to wield enormous influence over markets, agricultural research and policy-development, which undermines food sovereignty.

2020 was a horrific year for food security and health – but a bonanza for Big Food and Big Ag. Food Barons made the most of the converging crises in order to tighten their grip on every link in the Industrial Food Chain. In doing so, they undermine the rights of peasants, smallholders, fishers and pastoralists to produce food for their own communities and many others.

The Food Barrons are accelerating digitalization of food and agriculture across the chain in order to hold on to, naturalize and expand their power, despite their many failings.

It’s time to divest from the Industrial Food Chain.”

Although they arent critical of climate hoax, the analysis of multinational companies seeking to control is worthwhile - full report:  https://www.etcgroup.org/sites/www.etcgroup.org/files/files/food-barons-2022-full_sectors-final_16_sept.pdf</description>

      <description>Good piece : BIG VEGANISM is cover for corporate takeover of food production!

“Multinationals love the phrase “plant-based” because it is a euphemism for the messianic, cultish, modish cause they have adopted: veganism.”

Some of the alt-protein research in Food Valley is directed towards consuming insects (“entomophagy”); some is more focused on algae, fungi — or mycobacterial this, that and the other. But the big research bucks are flowing one way only, and that is to plant-based alternatives to meat.

      <description>Power down? Try salt curing for a low-electricity alternative

Power cuts, rationing or sky-high energy prices? Who knows what this season will hold. Cooking without power may sound apocalyptic, but there are plenty of ways to get creative in the kitchen, all while keeping electricity use to a minimum.

One alternative is to cure food with salt.

From a chemical point of view, salt also has hygroscopic properties. When in contact with moist food, salt has the ability to absorb the water contained in the food. And it is this phenomenon that is interesting to note when it comes to cutting power use.

      <description>The BASF keystone:  as goes the gas, so goes BASF, so goes Germany, so goes Europe . . .

"Everything is connected at the German chemical firm BASF’s Ludwigshafen site, a 10 sq km industrial complex so large that byproducts from making ammonia, for example, are funnelled through a 1,771-mile pipe network to produce fertiliser, disinfectant, diesel exhaust fluid, or CO2 for fizzy drinks.

The plant is a giant integrated process — and it cannot run without a supply of natural gas.

“Once we can receive &lt; 50% of our maximum requirements, we would need to wind down the entire site,” says a  spokesperson.

The consequences of a BASF shutdown would be far-reaching, not just in Germany but the entire continent.

BASF-produced chemicals are used to make anything from toothpaste to vitamins, [and animal feed]. It's a top manufacturer of painkillers, and its largest customer industry is the automobile industry [— and AdBlue, which is required to run diesel engines, and keep trucking running ... ].

Over 12,000 honeybee hives have been destroyed since the mite was detected at the Port of Newcastle in June.

The first 100 days of the outbreak have already cost the economy over $63 million.

      <description>Top notch interview with Gabe Brown on regenerative methods to cultivate awesome soil which can't help but grow amazing amounts of food for your family!

——

Gabe Brown on Regenerative Solutions to Modern Problems – Ice Age Farmer Podcast

Gabe Brown of Browns Ranch — a pioneer of the soil-health movement and regenerative practices — joins Christian to discuss regenerative practices and soil health as the bottom line solutions to the myriad problems we face. We discuss the Covid19 pandemic and what we can learn from it, how healthy living soil helped Brown’s Ranch weather the difficult, cold and wet 2019 season in North Dakota — and can do the same for you! Producers from homesteaders/gardeners to larger farmer ranchers can start improving their operations immediately without huge capital investment. Gabe also describes how they have actually been getting a boost in sales due to their direct-to-market approach. And of course we describe the 6 rules for building amazing soil and growing lots of food!

..."Alternative proteins such as insects, lab-grown meat and new technologies such as producing proteins from carbon dioxide and water will be a complement on our plates in 18 years but not be the main source of protein. "

      <description>More food infrastructure burning - Canadian bridge causes grains transport issues:

“An entire economy is relying on these little ribbons of steel through Canada'

A bridge burned down on the Canadian National Railway Co. line, about 95 kilometres to the south, severing the only rail link in or out of Grande Prairie and causing backlogs for the grain shippers who depend on that track to get their product to port.

CN said the severed line only moves a fraction of the total grain coming off fields in Western Canada. But for grain farmers and exporters, the bridge fire was another example of the fragility of the national supply lines that connect one of the world’s most important bread baskets with seaports and global markets.

      <description>Wheat jumps over 4% on Black Sea supply concerns, corn firm

Chicago wheat rose over 4% on Monday on concerns a flare-up in the Russia-Ukraine conflict could create new threats to grain shipments from the Black Sea region

Corn rose on expectations of smaller crops in the U.S. and Europe.

      <description>Lab-grown milk to hit shelves by 2024 – minus the cow and the carbon

Welcome to the WEF's "post animal economy":

"A new animal-free milk promising to be more sustainable than dairy but with near-identical taste and nutritional content could hit supermarket shelves in the next two years, adding to the growing roster of milk alternatives available to Australian consumers."

      <description>Hey. What did you do TODAY to make yourself more RESILIENT for TOMORROW?

Have you been DOOMSCROLLING — or are you ACTIVELY investing in a de-centralized future: seed saving (food production), networking (community), energy systems (minimally solar+inverter+hot plate to cook!)

Lots to do - use these moments wisely!

      <description>Force majeure declarations have begun due to barges stopped in Mississippi due to low water levels

This affects not just the grains harvest, but fertilizer applications.

A logjam of ships, tugboats and barges due to low water levels on the Mississippi River is threatening to grind trade of grains, fertilizer and other goods to a halt, Bloomberg reports. Ingram Barge Company, the largest U.S. barge operator, declared force majeure in a letter to customers due to “near-historic” low water conditions on the Mississippi River. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Coast Guard said there was a queue of 122 vessels at Stack Island and 15 vessels at Memphis. Due to increased groundings, the number of vessels in tow is being restricted.

      <description>Unbelievable - Terrible timing to not be able to export grains/oilseeds:

U.S. barge backlog swells on parched Mississippi River

Commercial barge traffic on southern stretches of the Mississippi River was at a standstill on Tuesday as low water levels halted shipments of grain, fertilizer and other commodities on the critical waterway, shipping sources said.

The supply chain snarl comes just as harvesting of corn and soybeans, the largest U.S. cash crops, is ramping up and as tight global supplies and strong demand for food and fuel have sent inflation soaring.

Around 100 tow boats hauling some 1,600 barges were lined up for miles waiting to pass through one trouble spot near Lake Providence, Louisiana, that has been largely closed since late last week, shipping sources said.

At least two other sections of the lower Mississippi have also been closed at times, disrupting the flow of grain to U.S. Gulf Coast export terminals, where some 60% of U.S. corn, soybean and wheat exports exit the country, they said.

Shippers have been loading less cargo per barge so vessels sit higher on the water, and towing companies have reduced the number of barges per tow by nearly 40% as the low water conditions narrowed the navigable channel.

      <description>Dolphins, skunks, foxes now apparently have #BirdFlu as well — Remember : the agenda is “animals are dirty and dangerous and we must separate MAN from NATURE into the SmartCities!”

In Maine, an elevated number of gray and harbor seal deaths have been attributed to the disease, while in Florida, officials believe a bottle-nosed dolphin succumbed to the virus. It's also been detected in skunks and foxes.

After proliferating globally, a historic wave of avian flu has entered Southern California, where it is worrying farmers and bird lovers and could add to complications with supply chains and food prices.

In late August, one New Jersey park had to close its trails to hikers. There were too many dead vultures on the ground.

      <description>STUDY: Gates-funded Impossible Burger poisons rats

Rats fed GM yeast-derived protein soy leghemoglobin – the Impossible Burger’s key ingredient – showed signs of toxicity.

If you recall, the FDA at first hesitated about this GMO "heme" to make the Gates-funded thing "bleed," but when Whole Foods was purchased by Bezos, they sold it without FDA approval. The FDA approved soon thereafter.

Reject the synthetic food — grow your garden.

      <description>Vegetable/legume company HAK STOPS production for 6 weeks starting 2023. Energy prices make it infeasible to produce, says the market leader best known for the glass jars of applesauce, peas and brown beans.

"It is not only the high price, but also the uncertainty, says director Timo Hoogeboom. "Today it is two euros for a cubic meter of gas, it used to be three euros. We don't know what it will be in January or February. So to be on the safe side, we will remain closed."

If it is no longer possible to pass on the higher energy prices to consumers, the availability of products may ultimately also be compromised. "If companies have to sell below cost for months, things go wrong." He does not expect any empty shelves for HAK for the time being. "But I don't rule it out for the chain, especially in January, February and March." A temporary energy ceiling for companies could help, the HAK director thinks.

"Companies will first look at how they can absorb the costs themselves, but if that is no longer possible, they will have to scale down," confirms food economist Morren. "I expect this to happen more widely."

Video opens with a business owner heating her store with candles/terracotta:  "I lost my customers with COVID, and now inflation is so high people don't have money to buy children's clothes."

The elderly person with candle/terracotta heater is, to me, iconic of the strangulation that is gripping Europe in this engineered energy crisis.

      <description>French refinery strikes takes half of the nation’s refining capacity offline - forcing France’s largest sugar maker, Tereos, to curtail production

Diesel and petrol stations in France are running out of fuel, according to an industry union, as a refining strike takes its toll. The strike, which among others, took Total’s 240,000 bpd Gonfreville refinery offline as well as a couple of Exxon’s, was expected to conclude on Thursday…but Friday, reports came in that strikes were disrupting Total’s oil products refining and delivery for a fourth day — 60% of the nation’s total refining capacity.

“There is no need to rush to the station (for gas),” TotalEnergies said on Friday. Despite those affirmations, France’s largest sugar maker, Tereos, said it had to curtail production somewhat at some of its factories after Total advised it that it would not be able to supply it with any more diesel until the end of the week.

France was already battling a shortage of refined products, with Russia’s exports to Europe “falling” in recent months.

      <description>Bernese farmer’s 20 cows provide electricity and heat for several houses -- via biogas

Niklaus Hari converts manure and urine from his 20 cows into energy via a small biogas plant, providing electricity AND HEAT for several houses and a development.  “The main thing,” he says, “is we need the cows for their [manure].”

This is ANOTHER reason the WEF is so eager to reach the “Post Animal Economy” — only takes a small number of livestock to provide meat, dairy, and manure for fertilizer and energy.

To take control over FOOD, FERTILIZER, and ENERGY, they must eliminate animals from homesteads.

      <description>Hurricane Ian's damage to Florida fertilizer plant creates 'concern' about rising food prices

Hurricane Ian forced Florida fertilizer maker Mosaic Co. to halt operations across Polk County for an unspecified amount of time as disaster relief efforts get underway.

The company’s North American phosphate operations make up "approximately 50 percent of North American farmers’ supply of granular phosphate fertilizer, and 12 percent of the global supply" in a given year.

      <description>Hurricane Ian is poised to strike at the nation’s production of phosphate fertilizer, threatening supply as the cost of growing food in the US rises by the most ever.

“Florida is home to Mosaic Co.’s phosphate rock assets, where they mine product, and to facilities where they turn that rock into fertilizers like diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate, commonly known as DAP and MAP.

“Mosaic’s New Wales plant is ‘right in the middle of the damage swath,’ said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. It could ‘be out for weeks,’ he said in an email.”

      <description>German producers warn of food shortages

“Act now – otherwise the refrigerators and freezers of the German population will soon be empty,”

Manufacturers of both frozen and fresh products say they cannot cope with soaring energy costs

“There are significant supply gaps in the daily food supply for people in Germany. The situation is more than serious,” an open letter from the industry said.

“Companies now fear that production lines will soon come to a standstill and that refrigerated logistics centers for food distribution will be closed. Some are even preparing for possible insolvency.”

      <description>BeyondMeat COO arrested for biting man’s nose at college football game.

The irony here is rich (“FAKE MEAT EXEC EATS MAN!”) but the bigger crime remains BeyondMeat’s goal of ending ranching and animal homesteading, and telling kids their parents don’t love them if they feed them meat, and “just don’t understand” that fake meat is friendlier to the planet.

Beyond is a criminal organization funded by criminal Gates and they are the enemy of humanity.

And they eat noses.

      <description>USDA investing $2.8 billion in ‘climate-smart’ agriculture

The rhetoric:
“There is strong and growing interest in the private sector and among consumers for food that is grown in a climate-friendly way”

The reality:
Riceland Foods is one of the company’s receiving funding. $20 million from the USDA to create a farmer-friendly [😂] system to support adoption of climate-smart practices and interact with commodity buyers in climate-smart markets.”

BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
“Riceland will build a farmer-focused asset registry system for data collection, benefit quantification, verification and farmer compensation.”

SO IT’S A TRACKING SYSTEM—perfect awareness of all resources. Agenda 2030 style. Just slap “farmer friendly” and “climate smart” on it instead of calling it what it is: total surveillance of food production.

USDA conducting #WarOnFarms.

      <description>France to reap worst corn harvest in decades

French farmers are harvesting their smallest corn crop in more than three decades, following the worst drought in at least 500 years that has hit the continent.

The smaller crops in France, which is one of Europe’s agricultural heavyweights, could drive soaring food prices even higher. Fields in Germany and Romania, other key EU producers, have also suffered from drought.

(Cue the media blaming climate change and calls for zero carbon)
