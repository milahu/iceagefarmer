      <description>CO2 shortage threatens New Zealand chicken supplies

Plans are in progress to reduce production of some chicken products, according to the country’s leading poultry meat producer.

Tegel is warning that it may not be able to produce some chicken products because of a shortage of carbon dioxide gas in New Zealand that is also threatening brewers and fizzy drinks makers.

The Food and Grocery Council said the availability of cheese, preserved meats, sparkling wine and ready-to-eat meals could also suffer, with price rises possible.

The Brewers Association and the Beverage Council separately voiced concerns about the gas shortage on Saturday.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is used widely in the food industry – including in packaging to preserve the shelf life of chicken – and to add fizz to drinks, as well as in other industries such as healthcare.

Businesses used to get much of their CO2 supply from the Marsden Point oil refinery, which produced CO2 as a by-product of its refining operation until that was replaced in favor of importing energy.

      <description>Libya declares force majeure on oil exports after weeks of protests and port blockades.

This is major news on its own, but also needs to be considered from Europe's perspective:

- 6% of EU oil &amp; gas imports are from Libya and were just taken off the table.
- 34% of EU oil and 55% of gas comes from Russia, which is being throttled
- Freeport terminal in TX was blown up and cannot send LNG
- UK just announced they'd stop gas exports to EU if there were shortages
- EU and UK are both frantically burning gas just to generate electricity now, instead of storing for the winter ahead!

- Greenhouses, food plants and facilities are ALREADY SHUT DOWN due to the cost of energy — and somehow things keep blowing up!  This is an absolute CONTROLLED DEMOLITION.

Europe is being strangled !!

People with COVID-19 can infect and sicken cats and dogs by cuddling them, says study

The study said that while it was already known that animals including cats, dogs, ferrets and hamsters seem to be susceptible to COVID-19, transmission may be happening more often than previously thought.

"These data indicate relatively common transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to animals and that certain human-animal contacts — example, kissing the pet, pet sleeping on the bed — appear to increase the risk," said the study.

Transmission from humans to animals can be minimized by owners keeping their distance, wearing a mask and taking other precautions, just as they would to prevent infecting a person, he said.

      <description>No Russian Gas -&gt; No Eggs!  Farmers warn an energy crisis is ALSO a FOOD CRISIS.

Without natural gas supplies, there are immediate animal welfare problems on the farms. From the hatchery to the barn to the slaughterhouse, all companies in the poultry industry are dependent on the energy source.  [IAF:  and thus, these are being shut down by design.]

Short-term energy restrictions would have "an immediate impact on the food security of the residents".

The poultry industry is energy-intensive. "For the Lower Saxony poultry industry alone, including the production of poultry feed [!!!] we have calculated an annual gas requirement of around 1,735,311 megawatt hours."

      <description>Ukraine: gain exports plummet 44% year over year:

Ukraine exported 1.11 million tonnes of grain in the first 22 days of June, down 44% from the same period in 2021, Reuters reported, citing agriculture ministry data released June 27.

The volumes included 978,000 tonnes of corn, 104,000 tonnes of wheat and 24,000 tonnes of barley, the data showed. Ukraine exported up to 6 million tonnes of grain a month before Russia launched an invasion on Feb. 24.

Ukraine is among the world’s largest exporters of wheat and corn. Exporters are struggling to get what’s left in storage out of the country, because Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea, like the key city of Odessa, are under blockade by Russia.

      <description>Possible foot and mouth disease case investigated at pig farm in Norfolk (UK)

A possible outbreak of foot and mouth disease is being investigated at a Norfolk pig farm - sparking major worries for the region's livestock industry.

Defra has enforced a 10km Temporary Control Zone for foot and mouth disease at a farm between Feltwell and Brandon.

The precautionary measure was put in place at 10pm on Thursday "following suspicion of vesicular disease in pigs".

      <description>BOOM ! Suddenly it's YOUR backyard chickens that are causing pandemics, not industrial agriculture.  This was the plan all along to take total control over food production!

 &gt; "If we can’t dramatically cut meat consumption then intensive ‘factory farming’ may be comparatively less risky" because “non-intensive” or “low-yield” farms [IAF: ie. anyone producing their own food other than large industrial technocrat owned operations] pose a serious risk to human health as they need far more land to produce the same amount of food [this is also a lie!].

"This, it is argued, increases the chances of “spillover” of dangerous viruses between animals and humans because it drives habitat loss, which displaces disease-carrying wild animals such as bats and rodents and brings them into closer contact with farmed animals and humans."

... and this builds on that weird Fauci paper blaming all pandemics on humans interacting with nature — the goal is to divorce man from God's creation. #transhumanism

      <description>“Unprecedented” Summer Snow Hits Afghanistan; Similarly In India And Pakistan, Rare Mid-June Freeze Delivers Heavy Snowfall; + Unusual Cold Sweeps Namibia

Unprecedented and heavy snowfall has struck central Afghanistan which, at this time of the year, poses a threat to young livestock and tender crops.

Residents in various towns and villages of Bamyan province have reported snow down to an unusually low elevation, even as the calendar reads summer — unprecedented in at least the last 20 years.

      <description>AUS: Fruit and vegetable costs to skyrocket in coming weeks

Aussies are being warned the price of all fruit and vegetables will spike in coming weeks as farmers face labor shortages and growing production costs.

Tyson Cattle, from the national industry representative AusVeg, told Today the issues were critical and "impacting grower confidence to plant more crops".

"They're unable to access the pickers and packers needed to actually get crops off the ground and onto supermarket shelves," Tyson told Today.

      <description>Dutch farmers protest government's decision to cut chicken flocks by 30% for "nitrogen savings"

The War on Meat continues...

The Netherlands, the world's second-largest agricultural exporter, is one of the top greenhouse gas emitters in Europe -- especially of nitrogen -- with much of this blamed on cattle-produced manure and fertiliser.

Farmers say they are targeted while big business and industry slide, with many vowing to resist any plans to scale down or close farms.

"It's not normal, what's being done to the farmers," 74-year old protester Jan Poorter told AFP. ""You can't just close farms that are hundreds of years old. You just can't!"

      <description>UN Food Chief Halves Refugee Meal Rations As Global Hunger Crisis Worsens 

Too bad people can’t simply eat half as much…

“On Monday, David Beasley, director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), released a statement detailing "the heartbreaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival."
"As global hunger soars way beyond the resources available to feed all the families who desperately need WFP's help, we are being forced to make the heartbreaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival," Beasley said.

      <description>Iranian schools, hospitals facing food shortages as prices skyrocket

Local media in Iran say public institutions such as hospital, prisons, and child-care centers are facing possible food shortages due to skyrocketing prices.

The Tehran-based Etemad newspaper reported on June 15 that the impending “problem” could hit in “the coming weeks” and that “food supplies will be disrupted not only in hospitals but also in other government facilities such as barracks, prisons, nursing homes, and even student dormitories.”

Etemad quoted the head of a private hospital as saying that a sharp rise in food prices has affected the quality of hospital food to such an extent that freshly made items are likely to be eliminated in public and private hospitals, with packaged foods being used instead.

The head of the hospital, who asked not to be identified, added: “In the coming weeks, it will be impossible for many public or private medical centers to provide hot meals, especially protein-rich foods, to hospitalized patients because this increase in food prices was not seen in any hospital budget.”

      <description>As Po dries up, Italy's food and energy supplies are at risk

Water is so low in large stretches of Italy's largest river that local residents are walking through the middle of the expanse of sand and shipwrecks are resurfacing.

Authorities fear that if it doesn't rain soon, there'll be a serious shortage of water for drinking and irrigation for farmers and local populations across the whole of northern Italy.

      <description>‘Marching towards starvation’: UN warns of hell on earth if Ukraine war goes on

Unprecedented food shortages could spark riots in dozens of countries as Black Sea blockade adds to pressures, says WFP chief

Dozens of countries risk protests, riots and political violence this year as food prices surge around the world, the head of the food-aid branch of the United Nations has warned.

Director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), said the world faced “frightening” shortages that could destabilise countries that depend on wheat exports from Ukraine and Russia.

“Even before the Ukraine crisis, we were facing an unprecedented global food crisis because of Covid and fuel price increases,” said Beasley. “Then, we thought it couldn’t get any worse, but this war has been devastating.”

      <description>World's Largest Cricket protein 'factory' completed in Ontario — "you really will eat ze bugs":

Aspire’s new plant will reportedly produce 9000 metric tons of crickets every year for human and pet consumption.  — about two billion insects to be distributed annually across Canada and throughout the United States.

Aspire also reports that it already has orders for the next two years.

Crickets are currently being explored as a protein-rich superfood. They contain fibre and are already found in grocery stores and restaurants, and have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional protein sources.

      <description>“Shock report” reveals food prices could go up 15% over the summer, squeezing family finances further

“Some families may have to skip meals as inflation continues to rise. The report also mentioned that the UK economy is facing its “strongest period” of inflationary pressure since the 1970s, with the conflict in Ukraine worsening the impact by restricting supply chains and pushing up grain prices.”

UK: Food prices could go up by 15% over the summer, adding to the stress on families facing rising petrol and energy bills. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) said in a report that households are set to pay more for essentials including dairy, bread and meat.

      <description>Stunning footage of thousands (10k+) of dead cattle in Kansas yesterday.

It is reported these cattle died of excessive heat —  while temps were not excessively high, there was also high humidity and no wind.

Others are speculating that this is exceptional even for summer heat, and this is another blatant destructive act perpetrated on our food supply.

What do you think?

The crushing reality of record diesel fuel prices is pushing farmers to the brink and may affect food availability. &lt;- [READ IT AGAIN]

“We have reached that point to where it is very close to being a sinking ship,” Kotzmoyer, a legislative affairs specialist for the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau, testified to state lawmakers Tuesday. “We are teetering on the edge right now.

      <description>Trucker Strike In South Korea Sparks Economic Turmoil, Risks Global Spillover

The epicenter of the next global supply chain snarl could be in South Korea as a nationwide trucker strike broadens and is hindering domestic economic activity, which may spill over to the rest of the world.

Bloomberg reports that the Cargo Truckers Solidarity Union entered its seventh day of strikes on Monday, causing $1.6 billion in disruptions for auto, petrochemical, steel, and other top industries.

      <description>WTO declares 'Polycrisis', requiring global government, as no one country can solve it — a worldwide problem/reaction/solution:

“This polycrisis... is really unprecedented. And what is very central to all of this is that no one country can solve this crisis on its own. This is the time that you need the world working together. You need global solidarity,” she said.

The WTO chief drew attention to export controls, which, as she repeatedly stated, should be eased in order to avoid making an already dire situation worse. [IAF: this was precisely the script from Podesta's 2015 'Food Chain Reaction Game']

So this is the "Global problems require global solutions" narrative now for food shortages, as has also been used with "climate crisis" and covid.

      <description>US Foods union relations are souring, and they "put the foodservice giant on notice that work stoppages are imminent." This means that unresolved work contract negotiations between the labor union and the foodservice distributor could result in a strike that may disrupt the flow of food products to tens of thousands of restaurants.

      <description>UN warns of food catastrophe

Without fertilizers, shortages will spread from corn and wheat to all staple crops, including rice, with a devastating impact on billions of people in Asia and South America, too. This year’s food crisis is about lack of access.  Next year’s could be about lack of food,” he added.

Unfortunately, dozens of countries may face a physical shortage of food. Millions of people may starve if Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea continues.

      <description>Bad grains harvest forecast for EU - including France, who is usually exporter

Worsens global outlook for #wheat shortages

"The EU is expected to produce almost 5% less wheat this year compared with 2021. It was also forecast to produce 278.8 million metric tons of all grains in the 2022-2023 growing season, down over 4% from last year, because of the dry weather.

Production in France, which is the fifth-largest grower of wheat in the world, was also projected to decline by more than 5%. The country accounts for about 18% of European agricultural production, according to the French Ministry of Agriculture. France is also the fourth-biggest wheat exporter globally.

In addition to dry weather, the country’s agricultural land has been hit with severe storms, that damaged wheat, fruit and vineyard land.

      <description>"Large supply gaps in turkey will begin Q3." Bird Flu was confirmed in "our supply chain" in March. A top US food processing company warned of an upcoming shortage of its turkey products at supermarkets following one of the worst bird flu outbreaks.

"Our Jennie-O Turkey Store team is facing an uncertain period ahead," Hormel Foods Corporation CEO Jim Snee told investors in an earnings call.

Since the USDA first detected bird flu in the US in mid-February, more than 38 million birds in 35 states have died. Out of that figure, 5 million turkeys in the US have been killed, with most deaths in Minnesota and South Dakota.

“They currently have a proposal underway to deciminate all the Pick your own farms in NSW and want to put unrealistic limitations on the number of visitors per day that attend these farms.  The current proposal they have is to only allow 50 people per day to attend the farms and a maximum of 10 days per year that these farms  are allowed to open for PYO.”

      <description>German Farmers warn food prices will continue to escalate

The conflict in Ukraine and its economic fallout have had “a massive impact on German agriculture,” Joachim Rukwied, president of the German Farmers’ Association, said in an interview with the Passauer Neue Presse.

“Energy prices have doubled, the price of fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizers, has quadrupled on average, and fodder costs more,” he explained, adding that the situation was “disastrous” for pig farmers in particular.

According to Rukwied, food has been sold below value in recent years, and prices have to go up for farmers to be able to continue to farm at all. Inflation in Germany hit 7.9% in May, according to official statistics, reaching its highest level since reunification. The levels are also similar to those seen during the 1970s oil crisis.

      <description>Doctors baffled by increase in “Sudden Adult Death Syndrome” (SADS)

Sudden Adult Death Syndrom (SADS) is an “umbrella term to describe unexpected deaths in young people” and an increase in these ‘mysterious’ deaths in Australia is said to have left doctors in the country baffled.

Doctors hope to roll out a new SADS registry across the country in order to monitor this sudden death phenomenon.

Experts are Baffled…

      <description>Is US/NATO (with WEF help) pushing for a Global South famine?

Is the proxy war in Ukraine turning out to be only a lead-up to something larger, involving world famine and a foreign-exchange crisis for food- and oil-deficit countries?

Many more people are likely to die of famine and economic disruption than on the Ukrainian battlefield.

“Russia accounts for 40% of the world’s grain trade and 25 percent of the world fertilizer market (45 percent if Belarus is included). Any scenario would have included a calculation that if so large a volume of grain and fertilizer was withdrawn from the market, prices would soar, just as they have done for oil and gas.

      <description>Biden calls on farmers to produce "double crop" (but does nothing to help them with the exploding operational costs), yet invokes the Defense Production Act to produce solar panels.  And again raises the ethanol requirements (burn more corn for fuel)!

This is not just climate virtue signaling - it is the state taking control of the economy and misallocating resources to green nonsense that does not solve our energy problems, while depriving funding to traditional farming and ranching that could actually produce food.

This is an engineered food crisis.

      <description>South Africa:  ports unable to export food:

The Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) recently said that South Africa’s agricultural sector is being hit by bottlenecks at South African ports, adding that there is a struggle to get table grapes out into international markets within 21 days – currently it takes 50 days.

“Perishable cargo like fruit is only covered by specific extensions to cover delay and this is provided by a limited number of insurers. The number of insurers who offered the extended cover are now declining this cover due to the increased delays in worldwide shipping from 2020 that is ongoing. The infrastructure troubles we are having, as well as the result of the KZN floods, is likely to add further delays, which may result in insurers no longer offering delay cover at all.”

      <description>Spain: 80% of stone fruit production lost

Frosts took a severe toll on pome and stone fruit trees in northeastern Spain in late March. The production in the regions of Aragon and Catalonia suffered historic volume losses in a year in which production costs have soared due to inflation.

"We have lost 80% of our stone fruit production," said Sergio Alonso, commercial director of the Cosanse cooperative in Zaragoza. In the case of cherries, the damage has not been as severe and we have been able to save 50-60% of the production, while in that of apples and pears we will have 60-70% of the production.

      <description>The Russian government plans to allow ships carrying grain supplies to leave the port of Odessa in Ukraine, according to a report, easing a blockade that has triggered fears of widespread shortages and hunger.

The Russian leadership has agreed with Kyiv and Ankara on a scheme to release grain shipments from Odessa, which has been subject to a blockade, the pro-government Izvestia reported, citing government circles.

"In the territorial waters of the neighboring country, Turkish military forces will take over the demining and they will also escort the ships as far as neutral waters," Monday's report said.

Russian warships would then escort the vessels carrying grain to the Bosporus. https://www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/turkey-russia-agree-on-ukrainian-grain-exports-from-odessa-izvestia</description>

      <description>Egypt BANS all transactions of wheat other than selling to the government.  This is the next domino to fall as the big producers ban exports — countries that need imports (like Egypt) start to take total control of what remains and ration it:

—
Egypt banned trading of wheat by third parties until the end of August, the cabinet said on Tuesday, preventing any sales other than to the government.

Egypt aims to buy the whole harvest from local farmers, as it targets 6 million tonnes of domestic wheat this year after the Ukraine war cut it off from much of the Black Sea wheat it relied on.

      <description>U.S. wheat crop hit by dry winter then soggy spring, adding to global tightness

North Dakota farmer Dwight Grotberg wanted to plant more wheat this spring to capitalize on soaring prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine cut grain exports and left the world short of millions of tonnes of wheat supply.

Heavy rain has prevented Grotberg from planting as much wheat crop as he wanted and is hampering farmers across the state, the top U.S. grower of spring wheat.

      <description>Another egg producer burns to the ground - “It was unbelievable how quick it grew, it was insane,” Andy Trebesch said. “It was the whole sky, it was quite large.”

Tens of thousands of chickens burned at the farm, started in 1918, sold more than three million eggs a day to some of the nation’s largest retailers.

A spectacular fire demolished M &amp; E Seed and Grain Co. in Prosser and left one person with burns. A smoldering pile of twisted metal and charred lumber was all that remained Thursday morning after firefighters battled the blaze in downtown Prosser all night.

      <description>“UK Woman stops eating to afford feeding her child” — while these headlines are sad, it seems they are more about tugging on heartstrings to justify the concepts of Nutritional Security, i.e. food as UBI (Universal Basic Income), and push the zeitgeist forward into mindset of food scarcity.

      <description>IRAN: Digital Food Rationing rolls out using Biometric IDs amid food riots

Iran is set to be the first country to roll out a food rationing scheme based on new biometric IDs.  Where vaccine passports failed, food passports will now be eagerly accepted by hungry people who can't afford rapidly inflating food prices.  This is the realization of a longstanding agenda by the Rockefeller/UN/WEF crowd to, as Kissinger put it, "control food, and control people."  Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

      <description>Cows may need permit to graze meadows in Netherlands

Dairy farmers are angry and surprised now that a court decision opens the door to a  permit requirement to let cows roam in the meadow. “This shows the absurdity of the nitrogen policy,” says Trienke Elshof, a farmer in Oldetrijne.

      <description>Amish Farmer Faces $250K Fine, Jail Time And Losing His Sustainable Farm For Processing His Own Meat

A federal judge told Miller to cease and desist all meat sales, and sent armed U.S. marshals to search his property, farm store and freezers. They took an inventory of all his meat to make sure he doesn’t sell any or slaughter anymore animals.

Last summer, the judge also ordered Miller to pay $250,000 for “contempt of court,” and said he will also have to pay the salaries of the USDA investigators assigned to his case, $50,000 of which was due last week as a “good faith” payment to avoid jail.

      <description>Farmers left heartbroken as Queensland floods ruin crops

Shoppers warned the price of fresh fruit and vegetables will rise after latest rain event

Farmers who risked planting after the February deluge lost entire crops and face financial ruin after the second deluge.

Lockyer Valley’s mayor, Tanya Milligan, said crops were rotting in the ground and 90% of insurance claims have been rejected.

“A lot of those farmers were hoping and depending on that (insurance payout),” Milligan said.

“We will have farmers that have no intention to replant. You have people that have just lost absolutely everything and they will be wondering is it all worth it?

      <description>Never seen such an honest appraisal from a public servant of an absolutely catastrophic situation as Sri Lanka’s new prime minister just shared - full transcript is linked, and worth reading:

“The next couple of months will be the most difficult ones of our lives. We must prepare ourselves to make some sacrifices and face the challenges of this period.
I have no desire to hide the truth and to lie to the public. Although these facts are unpleasant and terrifying, this is the true situation. For a short period, our future will be even more difficult than the tough times that we have passed. We will face considerable challenges and adversity.

      <description>Note that Iran plans to use "Digital Coupons" to get bread.  “Other food items will be added later."  -- We are already arriving at digital food rationing.

Soaring bread prices spark protests and shop fires in Iran

Soaring bread prices have triggered protests in Iran in which some shops were set on fire, prompting police to arrest scores of "provocateurs"

The protests were triggered by a cut in government subsidies for imported wheat that caused price hikes as high as 300 percent for a variety of flour-based staples.

Iran’s official inflation rate is around 40%, and some estimate it is over 50%. Almost half Iran’s 82 million population are now below the poverty line.

The government plans to offer digital coupons in the next couple of months for limited amounts of bread at subsidised prices. The rest will be offered at market rates. Other food items will be added later.

      <description>Italy: African Swine Fever prompts culling of 2.1 million boar, export bans

The European Union on Monday told Italy to establish an infected zone for African swine fever in areas of Rome and implement special control measures to stop it spreading.

    It said Italy must "ensure that consignments of porcine animals kept in the areas listed as an infected zone... and products thereof are not authorised for movements to other Member States and to third countries".

    The government plans to cull wild boar, after several cases of swine fever were detected in Rome and with the animals becoming increasingly brazen about their encroachments into residential areas as they forage, especially in the capital.

    The Rome cases, which rose to six Friday, are the first outside the area of the original outbreak in Liguria and Piedmont.

    The authorities said two more cases were found in Liguria on Monday, taking the total for that region and Piedmont up to 119.

    The Coldiretti farm group said some 2.1 million boar needed to be culled in Italy as "a real risk to public safety". (ANSA).

      <description>It’s gone from a few stories to something I’m hearing again and again across states:  some birds die — no usual signs of bird flu — state comes in and runs PCR, declares outbreak and kills birds all around for miles.

Contaminated feed, even just one brand, would be a great excuse to come in and wipe out poultry producers like this.

If anyone is losing birds and able to test their feed, please do reach out and share results: iceagefarmer@protonmail.com
