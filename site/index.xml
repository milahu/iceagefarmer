      <description>German producers warn of food shortages

‚ÄúAct now ‚Äì otherwise the refrigerators and freezers of the German population will soon be empty,‚Äù

Manufacturers of both frozen and fresh products say they cannot cope with soaring energy costs

‚ÄúThere are significant supply gaps in the daily food supply for people in Germany. The situation is more than serious,‚Äù an open letter from the industry said.

‚ÄúCompanies now fear that production lines will soon come to a standstill and that refrigerated logistics centers for food distribution will be closed. Some are even preparing for possible insolvency.‚Äù

      <description>USDA investing $2.8 billion in ‚Äòclimate-smart‚Äô agriculture

The rhetoric:
‚ÄúThere is strong and growing interest in the private sector and among consumers for food that is grown in a climate-friendly way‚Äù

The reality:
Riceland Foods is one of the company‚Äôs receiving funding. $20 million from the USDA to create a farmer-friendly [üòÇ] system to support adoption of climate-smart practices and interact with commodity buyers in climate-smart markets.‚Äù

BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
‚ÄúRiceland will build a farmer-focused asset registry system for data collection, benefit quantification, verification and farmer compensation.‚Äù

SO IT‚ÄôS A TRACKING SYSTEM‚Äîperfect awareness of all resources. Agenda 2030 style. Just slap ‚Äúfarmer friendly‚Äù and ‚Äúclimate smart‚Äù on it instead of calling it what it is: total surveillance of food production.

USDA conducting #WarOnFarms.

      <description>France to reap worst corn harvest in decades

French farmers are harvesting their smallest corn crop in more than three decades, following the worst drought in at least 500 years that has hit the continent.

The smaller crops in France, which is one of Europe‚Äôs agricultural heavyweights, could drive soaring food prices even higher. Fields in Germany and Romania, other key EU producers, have also suffered from drought.

(Cue the media blaming climate change and calls for zero carbon)

      <description>Europe‚Äôs Natural Gas Shortage Could Trigger A Food Crisis

Governments are using every tool in their kits to curb the rising inflation rates, there‚Äôs far less they can do about the coming food shortage.

"Countries can't mandate fertilizer production because they are so worried about having enough natural gas to heat people's homes," John Harpole, a natural gas broker for the fertilizer sector told Newsweek. "They are having to choose between future food production and heat and they are going to choose heat."

The problem with an energy crisis is that it‚Äôs actually an everything crisis. In a world where virtually every industry relies on energy in some form, runaway inflation is an inevitability.

      <description>France bracing for ‚Äòcatastrophic‚Äô food shortages and price hikes following drought, farmers and unions warn

After four severe heatwaves this year record high temperatures have wreaked havoc on crops and could have a devastating impact on the availability of food across the rest of Europe.

France is the leading European exporter of potatoes with more than two million tonnes of the crop being exported each year.

Food producers say nearly 1.5 million tonnes of potato crops could be lost due to the heatwave ‚Äî a drop of 20 per cent.

Geoffroy d‚ÄôEvry, a farmer in the Oise region and president of potato-growers‚Äô union UNPT, said: ‚ÄúWe have never experienced a situation like this.

‚ÄúWe were preparing to spend the winter without heating or electricity, and now we discover that there may not even be potatoes for dinner?‚Äù  [Welcome to the Great Reset ‚Äî this is why we prepared.]

The Legumes de France federation has also estimated losses of between 25 and 35 per cent of the production and yield of vegetables.

This is actually similar to to the Iranian scheme of subsidizing only a few items a week ‚Äî everyone is free to purchase as much EXPENSIVE food as you want (can), but for those of us swept up in the intentional economic devastation, well, you only get three packs of affordable vegan hot dogs, slave.

      <description>Russia promises to provide FREE fertilizer and increased grain exports to ‚Äúpoor countries‚Äù ‚Äî this has been under- [un-] reported in western media:
_

Russia is set to ramp up grain exports, seeking to supply some 30 million tons this year, President Vladimir Putin has announced. The supplies will prioritize less well off and food-insecure nations.

‚ÄúWe believe it to be right to ramp up deliveries to the poorest countries,‚Äù Putin said during a meeting of the Security Council on Friday.

‚ÄúIn total, by the end of this year, we will supply some 30 million tons of grain and are ready to increase this volume to 50 million tons or more, because, thank God, we have a good harvest this year,‚Äù he added.

Moscow is also ready to supply fertilizers to the poorest nations free of charge, the Russian president said. ‚ÄúOur producers ‚Äî we‚Äôre talking about potash fertilizers ‚Äì are ready to deliver them free of charge to developing nations that urgently need them,‚Äù Putin said, instructing the Russian Foreign Ministry to work on the plan.

      <description>Another mass kill of livestock:  57,000 cows perish in India - milk shortages and "hundreds of carcasses of dead cows have been found lying in the open, causing a nauseating stench, with crows and vultures feeding on them."

Media asking "Why" ‚Äî some farmers suggesting the cows were recently vaxxed against Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD).

"Pictures taken with the help of drone cameras reveal a large number of carcasses spread over several square kilometre area. In some places, it is even difficult to keep a count of those dead."

      <description>Ohio: another 3 million chickens euthanized due to claimed #BirdFlu - one of the largest egg laying operations in US

An outbreak of bird flu that has led to the deaths of 43 million chickens and turkeys this year across the U.S. has been found at a giant egg-laying operation in Ohio, state and federal agriculture officials said Wednesday.

The case confirmed over the weekend in Ohio‚Äôs Defiance County has affected roughly 3 million chickens, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The egg-laying farm has started euthanizing all of its flock, said Dennis Summers, the state‚Äôs veterinarian.

      <description>World‚Äôs largest rice exporter restricts shipments

India has banned sending broken rice abroad and imposed a 20% duty on other varieties.

The South Asian nation cited food security concerns in making the move, which was announced on Thursday, as below-average monsoon rainfall had curtailed planting. India exports rice to more than 150 countries.

IceAgeFarmer note: this is the ‚Äúfood nationalism‚Äù that was described by Podesta‚Äôs Food Chain Reaction Game leading to massive geopolitical instability and hunger

UN Food Official Warns Fertilizer Affordability Crisis Could Slash Global Grain Production By 40%

Global fertilizer shortages threaten to starve a planet as prices are too high for some farmers ahead of the next planting season.¬†

That's the view of Maximo Torero, chief economist from the Food &amp; Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), who told Bloomberg TV that elevated fertilizer prices could decrease global grain production by upwards of 40% in the next planting season.¬†

Sadly, we‚Äôll see more of this in the days ahead.

      <description>Sugar and Salt Shortage Worsens Philippines Food Supply Woes

A top soft-drinks maker with no sugar, a burger joint out of onions and kitchens short of salt underscore the dependence of the Philippines on food imports and illustrate some of the cost  pressures fueling inflation.

The country not only buys sugar, salt and garlic from abroad, but also imports a raft of other food commodities such as rice, wheat, corn and soybean meal, and that‚Äôs after global farm prices surged to a record this year on the back of lower world supply caused by drought, heat and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. ¬†

      <description>Biden/Trump have now mutually declared each other enemies of the state, within just the last days.

The stage is now set, and an extraordinarily dangerous show is about to begin. The USA likes to do things bigger and better, and this will be no exception.  Once this kicks off there will be no stopping it, and I expect escalation of crises and conflicts worldwide.

Keep your wits about you and continue moving away from the system, towards self-sufficiency in food, energy, medicine, local markets/currencies. Radical and rapid decentralization is the only way forward.

Comms will go down at some point.  I am grateful and honored to have shared this space with you.

Godspeed and God bless.

They declined to indicate why.

They neglected to provide a timeline for when this may be available again.

Regardless of the presumably forthcoming excuse, this is effectively an act of warfare as markets (domestic AND foreign) are now blind to what is going/coming from the US.

UPDATE: they now indicate there is an issue migrating to a new reporting system that should be resolved by mid september.  Interesting date given futures contracts‚Ä¶

      <description>Fire at Biggest US Midwest Refinery Threatens Fuel Supplies

An outage at the largest US Midwest refinery is raising wholesale fuel prices regionally just as the agricultural sector gears up for its busiest time of year.

BP shut two crude units at its 435,000 barrel-a-day Whiting, Indiana, refinery after a fire Wednesday, Wood Mackenzie‚Äôs Genscape said. The fire occurred in the power house and caused a loss of cooling water, which could lead to damaged equipment, according to a person familiar with operations.

*** A prolonged shutdown of the plant, which supplies gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to most of the region‚Äôs major distribution centers, could tighten fuel markets just as farmers in the nation‚Äôs breadbasket prepare for harvesting season. ***

@iceagefarmer note: just another coincidence I‚Äôm sure.  Nothing to see here‚Ä¶

      <description>UK: Asda drops expiration dates on food.

@iceagefarmer note: I‚Äôd mentioned just two weeks ago that removing expiration dates from food was part of the EU ‚ÄúFarm to Fork‚Äù and Rockefeller ‚ÄúReset the Table‚Äù discussions ‚Äî and now we see it rolling out!

But, this is just a small change compared to the major changes coming for food #retail.

      <description>Aluminum producer Speira GmbH is considering cutting production at its German smelter to 50% of total capacity in response to surging energy costs that are squeezing power-intensive industries across Europe. The curtailment would add to the extreme toll that the energy crisis is having on Europe‚Äôs metals industry, which is one of the biggest industrial consumers of power and gas. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-23/german-aluminum-smelter-considers-halving-output-on-energy-costs#xj4y7vzkg</description>

      <description>Even more concerning than 50% crop loss, is that farmers are already blowing through their winter animal feed.  Clearly this means that by mid-winter, there will be no animal feed.  Which means come late winter, unless things change somehow, there will be no livestock.

"To make matters worse, livestock farmers in the region are also now struggling, with many being forced to give animals feed meant to be kept for the winter as the amount of edible grass on the ground quite literally has dried up.

"Fodder that might otherwise be imported from Russia or Ukraine is proving hard to come by as a result of the former‚Äôs invasion the latter and the West‚Äôs resulting sanctions war with Moscow..."

      <description>Germany:  50% crop loss due to drought in some regions

Up to half of the crops in parts of the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg are likely to be lost due to drought, farmers in the region have claimed, with problems to do with the prices of fuel, fertiliser, and pesticides connected to the green agenda and war in Ukraine also reportedly causing problems for those in the region

The serious lack of rainfall has led farmers to fear that the likes of maize, sugar beet, potato, and soybean crops could see losses of up to 50%.

      <description>POLAND: People are sleeping in their car just to stay in line for coal to heat their homes.

We can joke, "Thanks a lot Greta" but this is a serious situation and the complete collapse of Europe.  I can't believe that people aren't more upset with EU leadership at the self-imposed, utter destruction of energy supply, food supply, economy, livelihoods.  Perhaps once more people FEEL the pain this winter, we enter Klaus Schwab's "angrier world..."

      <description>India has banned wheat exports to protect domestic prices.

Here's why this is a really big deal as we enter full on #FoodWars.  Top wheat producers are being hit across the board:

#1  China.  (also #1 consumer!)
#2  India.  (and now exports are banned.)
#3  Russia (#1 exporter ‚Äî but Black Sea shipping is affected, and sanctions stop some buyers)
#4  USA (terrible season, drought)
#5  France (drought has severely impacted yields)
#6  Canada (spotty harvest so far)
#7  Germany (drought  has severely impacted yields)
#10 Ukraine

It is these nations that the rest of the world upon for their bread.  And bear in mind some major wheat exporters like Kazakhstan have banned wheat/flour exports.  Supplies are getting tight and countries are acting defensively.  No relief in sight as harvests are looking bad across Northern hemisphere and things are off to poor start in S. America.

Stock up and keep growing food!

      <description>More pushback, not just from farmers but now from Saskatchewan officials:

Saskatchewan warns Trudeau‚Äôs federal Nitrogen agents could be arrested

Saskatchewan Minister Jeremy Cockrill has sent a warning to the Trudeau government that officers sent by Ottawa will be arrested if they continue to trespass on farmland to test nitrogen levels.

According to Cockrill, Trudeau‚Äôs government has been unlawfully sending federal employees onto Saskatchewan farmlands to test for nitrogen levels without the consent of landowners.

In the letter, the Minister raised multiple complaints from Saskatchewan farmers that raised ‚Äúserious concerns about Government of Canada employees, in clearly marked Government of Canada vehicles, trespassing on private lands.‚Äù The farmers reporting these trespasses made clear that these government agents did not request permission to access the land and were not in any other manner given consent to access it.

What is more concerning to some than the actual trespass are the motivations of the federal agents. According to the land owners who confronted the federal agents trespassing on their land, they were told that the purpose of them being there was to test the water in the farmers‚Äô dugouts to measure nitrate levels.

      <description>The losses are catastrophic in every direction.  Italy:  extreme drought

Massimo Saronni walks across his rice field, each step a loud crunch. This field should be flooded with water, flourishing with four-foot emerald green blades and golden rice panicles. Instead, the plants have taken on a yellow-brown tinge and the soil has hardened from lack of rain. Small patches of survivors dot the field, but they only reach his ankle.

‚ÄúThese crops are seriously damaged. They haven‚Äôt had water, so they‚Äôre not going to make it,‚Äù says Saronni, who has worked as a rice farmer for over 30 years. He cultivates different rice varieties, including carnaroli, a high-starch rice prized in Italian cuisine for the creamy risotto it makes.

Northern Italy is suffering from spiking temperatures and its worst drought in more than 70 years.

Italy is the biggest producer of rice in the European Union‚Äîaccounting for over half of its total production‚Äîand importers of Italian rice will surely feel the pinch.

But now 2.2 million hectares of crops are dead due to drought.

This is a deliberate destruction of food supply to usher in complete control.

      <description>Mass crop failures expected in England

Half of the potato crop is expected to fail as it cannot be irrigated, and even crops that are usually drought-tolerant, such as maize, have been failing.

The group was told ‚Äúirrigation options are diminishing with reservoirs being emptied fast‚Äù, and losses of 10-50% are expected for crops including carrots, onions, sugar beet, apples and hops. Milk production is also down nationally because of a lack of food for cows, and wildfires are putting large areas of farmland at risk.

      <description>"I'm Shocked": US Crop Tour Reveals Drought-Stricken Cornfields

With Europen crops damaged by summerlong heatwaves and Argentina hit by drought, an underwhelming size of North America's crops could result in shortfalls globally next year.

Corn futures in Chicago rose to a six-week high on Tuesday as crop tours show much of the Western crop belt is plagued with drought conditions, especially in parts of Nebraska and South Dakota where plants aren't producing ears of grain

      <description>The data for crops is coming in and it is so staggering ‚Äî yields so reduced ‚Äî losses can no longer be hidden.  Next few posts will show yields suffering, particularly US, EU, and China.  Also, note that they are shifting the narrative to blame climate change, as the FOOD SHORTAGES will be how they justify the zero-carbon CLIMATE totalitarianism.

Europe‚Äôs Drought May Be Continent‚Äôs Worst in at Least 500 Years

Some 64% of the EU is under a drought warning or alert, according to a new report from the European Drought Observatory. The bloc‚Äôs experts said they expect the warm and dry conditions, which are fueling wildfires and reducing crop outputs, to continue in parts of the region until November.

‚ÄúThe combination of a severe drought and heat waves has created an unprecedented stress on water levels in the entire EU,‚Äù Mariya Gabriel, the bloc‚Äôs commissioner for research, said Tuesday in a statement. ‚ÄúClimate change is undoubtedly more noticeably every year.‚Äù

Several EU crops are being hit particularly hard, with the yield forecasts for grain 16% below the 5-year average, and 15% below it for maize, according to the latest data.

The effects of climate change are becoming more evident every year.

      <description>Your pigs are dirty and dangerous, experts announced, and could be responsible for food and mouth disease destroying the entire meat industry.  But huge corporate farms that the technocrats control are totally cool.

Why?  ‚ÄúSmaller producers are thought [?!] to be more likely [?!] to engage in practices such as swill feeding, that have a high chance of accidentally introducing the virus. They may be less aware of what they‚Äôre responsibilities are in terms of preventing an outbreak and also what they would need to do in an event of one.‚Äù  &lt;‚Äî This is the most flagrant, unfounded assumption!

Experts: you are too dumb to do it right, and therefore, we just need to make it illegal.

      <description>Backyard hens‚Äô eggs contain 40 times more lead on average than shop eggs, research finds

Note that it is explicitly your backyard birds that are suddenly at issue.

Newly published research found backyard hens‚Äô eggs contain, on average, more than 40 times the lead levels of commercially produced eggs.  For your safety, we may have to make your birds illegal, (just like we‚Äôve been salivating over)!

‚ÄúThese findings will come as a shock to many people who have turned to backyard food production. It has been on the rise over the past decade, spurred on recently by soaring grocery prices.  BUT, after years of living on these soils, contaminants have built up in soils. These legacy contaminants can enter our food chain via vegetables, honey bees and chickens.

[@IceAgeFarmer note:  it‚Äôs just too dangerous to let you feed your family.  if you want eggs, save up your carbon credits like everyone else.  More context in mega post above]

      <description>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a place now where you can‚Äôt live anywhere on the planet, and be sure that the environment is safe.‚Äù

So says the researcher who found toxic levels of PFAS (the forever chemical) in rain water samples.  The study intimates we are already at total contamination ‚Äî farms, gardens, animals raised outdoors ‚Äî all are so toxic they do not meet regulatory requirements.

Remember, they are already shutting down farms in Maine and around the US for PFAS contamination (full report here).

And thus, the globalists will own ALL food production ‚Äî the indoor farming, bug burgers, lab-grown eat that they‚Äôve been investing $100bb‚Äôs ‚Äî will be the only option.  As they told us, ‚Äúcompetition is sin.‚Äù  And they are taking out traditional farming and ranching.

      <description>My friends, this is the most important battle in human history. If we can't grow our own food, we depend forever on the system.   ‚Äî MEGA POST ‚Äî

__
‚ÄúAnimals are dirty and dangerous.  Rainwater is poisonous - you can't eat stuff that was grown outside!‚Äù  Traditional farming and ranching is antequated and illegal!‚Äù

Sounds ridiculous -- beyond belief!  But so does people wearing cloth masks OUTSIDE for two years.  These same people could be made to fear food overnight.

And this move is happening now:

* "Rainwater ALL over Earth has PFAS‚Äù -- new study claims ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù are now in gardens and animals raised outdoors -- remember they are already shutting down farms for PFAS contamination (see my report here) ‚Äî now extending the contamination to the entire biosphere!

 ... literally, from the researcher: "we‚Äôre in a place now where you can‚Äôt live anywhere on the planet, and be sure that the environment is safe.‚Äù  This is the design. The divorce of man from nature. Separation of us from God's creation. And it will be used to make traditional food ‚Äúdangerous and poisonous."  Now we see why the investment into indoor farming, and marketing lab-grown meat as "clean meat."  THEY ARE POISONING THE REST!

* ‚ÄúBackyard chickens are dangerous because of lead in eggs ‚Äî should be regulated -- it's explicitly the BACKYARD birds

- "Hobby farms are a risk for foot and mouth disease" -- dirty and dangerous!  It's explicitly the small HOBBY farms

- "Free Range" farming RAISES risk of pandemics -- surprise!  intensive corporate ‚Äòfactory farming‚Äô may actually be SAFER than you being able to raise your own animals!

Not to mention we have these biolabs researching every kind of pathogen from Bird Flu to African Swine Fever to take our food supply out.

In short, they are destroying traditional food and ranching, just as they are the energy infrastructures and monetary systems.

Prof. Richard Werner just remarked (here) that as central banks currencies fail, they must move to a new digital (#CBDC) model so people don‚Äôt take back their power with local currencies.  This same play is happening with food: as toxic big Ag fails, they poison the food supply and use weather warfare ‚Äî it is techno-salting the fields!

I may make separate posts with some of these links for easy sharability but it is all of these dots that form a picture that‚Äôs impossible to ignore.  This is the biggest takeover in human history.  Grow food, use cash/barter/local currency‚Äî do everything you can to de-centralize.  Our future depends on it.

      <description>Jersey‚Äôs largest veg producer stops growing food ‚Äî citing spiralling operational costs as the reason. They produced 80% of Jersey‚Äôs fresh vegetables. Now the island depends on UK produce and may see shortages of fresh vegetables, particularly in the winter months. ‚Äú‚ÄòObviously, it reduces food security because we lost our biggest vegetable producer,‚Äô ‚Äú

They have made it economically unviable to farm ‚Äî part of the #WarOnFarms.

      <description>Another grain mill mysteriously burns to the ground completely after spontaneously combusting.

Somehow all fire control systems failed in this facility...and the hundreds of other food supply plants that have burned this year.

Somehow it's like the fire safety was shut off...

In June ‚Äî just 60 days ago! ‚Äî Grain Craft announced it had been acquired by the Baltimore-based Redwood Capital Investments, headed by billionaires Jim Davis and Stephen Bisciotti.

And ‚Äî somehow ‚Äî now they are collecting on the insurance as starvation looms.

(Remember just a few months back billionaire Glen Taylor roasted 5.3 million birds alive "because #BirdFlu" ‚Äî but then fired all the workers and shutdown his poultry plant completely!?  These billionaires are getting the call...)

      <description>France: milk shortages feared

The president of the largest farmers' union in France has warned that a shortage of feedstock caused by severe drought may lead to a milk shortage.

"I think that in the coming months, we will have a shortage of milk in France. To make milk, you need fodder, mainly alfalfa and corn, which have grown little this year.‚Äù

      <description>Emergence of "black market food" more expensive than the government rations ‚Äî we will witness this anywhere there is rationing.

Lebanese face long ‚Äòinsulting‚Äô queues to buy bread

Khalil Mansour has to queue for hours every day just to buy bread for his family and some days he can‚Äôt afford any. In a country which once boasted the nickname ‚ÄúSwitzerland of the Middle East‚Äù for its thriving banking sector before financial crisis hit in 2019, the chronic shortage of the staple of the Lebanese diet has been hard to take.

Faced with demands from international creditors for painful reforms in return for the release of new aid, the embattled government has been forced to end subsidies on most essential goods ‚Äî although not so far on wheat. The price of subsidised bread has gone up, although by less than if there were no subsidy, but bakeries have started rationing the staple. A bag of flat Arabic pitta-like bread now officially sells for 13,000 Lebanese pounds (43 US cents). On the black market it costs more than 30,000. ‚ÄúLast week I went without bread for three days because I cannot afford to pay 30,000,‚Äù said Mansour, 48.

For Mansour and most Lebanese, buying bread means standing for hours in long queues outside bakeries and sometimes, when their turn comes, the bakeries have run out of bread.

A Chinese company, Fufeng Group, recently acquired 300 acres in North Dakota for $2.6 million. According to the company, it intends to establish a milling plant.

      <description>(see note below:)

German food banks suffer as former donors forced to become recipients

‚ÄúPeople who used to be on the other side donating and helping us are now coming and asking for help," says Petra Lehmann, who heads the Heimatstern association. "We have lots of families now where it's impossible from one income to feed the family because it's so expensive."
This is also changing people's behaviors. "We buy more jars of cheap food," says Sertap. "It may be chicken. It could be fish, beans because they are more suitable for us."

Pensioner Katrin Obermeier has started rationing her food: "I'm using foods longer, especially past the expiration date because it is still well preserved."

[IceAgeFarmer note: this is true BUT remember that removal of date markings by end of 2022 was planned in the 2018 EU Farm to Fork agenda!! We are following the globalist food crisis scripts to a T!!]

      <description>That sewer wastewater monitoring is sure turning out to be handy in the surveillance state.
__

Polio found in more wastewater samples in upstate New York‚Äôs Orange County

Wastewater samples taken from two different locations in Orange County in June and July tested positive for the virus, state officials told county leaders earlier this week.

The findings come days after the New York State Department of Health found similar evidence of community spread in sewage samples taken in neighboring Rockland despite no additional cases being reported.

State officials are urging anyone who is not vaccinated against the potentially life-threatening virus to get immunized after an unvaccinated adult in Rockland suffered paralysis and had to be hospitalized last month.

      <description>Greece rolls out digital ‚Äòwallet‚Äô for citizens; ID and driving license now on phone

[IAF: No doubt this is the kind of 'digital transformation' described for Ukraine as well... and everywhere...]

Greece has rolled out a mobile app that will replace the need to carry a police ID or a driver‚Äôs license in physical form, allowing faster transactions through a secure system calling for digital confirmation through a QR code, among others.

In addition, ‚ÄúWe are creating a system for banks and telecom providers starting October 1, as well as for agencies requiring the user to show an ID. A digital trace will be created instead of copies of one‚Äôs ID, turning into digital proof something that has been a burden to provide in physical form,‚Äù the minister said, referring to the police IDs required for most official transactions.
