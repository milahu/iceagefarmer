      <description>U.S. winter wheat farmers plant into dust as Plains drought persists

"It's sort of a grim situation," said Kent Winter, who farms in Andale, Kansas, outside Wichita. He said he normally seeds by mid-October but has yet to plant any.

[ IceAgeFarmer note:  I have never before seen #wheat trending on twitter … ]

The 2023 U.S. hard red winter wheat crop is already being hobbled by drought in the heart of the southern Plains, wheat experts said.

Planting plans may be scaled back in the U.S. breadbasket despite historically high prices for this time of year, reflecting rising global demand and thin world wheat supplies projected to end the 2022/23 marketing year at a six-year low. The tight supplies have been exacerbated as the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted grain exports from the Black Sea region.

The drought threatens Kansas, the top winter wheat growing state, and Oklahoma in two ways: discouraging farmers who have not yet planted from trying, while threatening crops already in the ground from developing properly.

      <description>Empty Shelves as Inflation Leaves Products Unprofitable

“Not only Mars [who worked hand in hand with Rockefeller Foundation on "Reset the Table”], but also Coca Cola [WEF partner] or Procter &amp; Gamble [WEF Partner]  are currently trying to ride the wave of inflation with excessive price demands in order to increase their returns,” a spokesman for the Edaka chain of supermarkets claimed.

The official went on to claim that a number of major companies have now halted deliveries to the chain, something that they alleged is being used to put pressure on supermarkets.

[IceAgeFarmer: the Rockefeller/WEF partners are squeezing you as hard as they can.]

——

Products ranging from Kellogg’s cornflakes to Coca Cola have disappeared from supermarkets throughout Germany, with many shops being left with empty shelves as products become simply unprofitable to sell due to differentials in inflation.

It comes as overall inflation hit 10% in the country in September, with EU-wide inflation for the month falling just short of 11% as a result of the ongoing #EnergyCrisis, which has in turn hiked the cost of food and other essential goods.

Retailers in the country however have strongly resisted this, with one supermarket chain in the country going so far as to accuse major companies of “price gouging” and “usury”.

“The situation in the industry is critical to catastrophic,” Federal Association of the Food Industry general manager Christoph Minhoff remarked regarding the feud, which has seen some individual rows even reportedly ending up in court as companies are unable to come to a compromise.

As a result of these ongoing hostilities between supermarkets and producers, a wide variety of well-known brands have disappeared from supermarkets throughout Germany, leaving many shops with empty shelves.

The likes of Coca Cola, Pepsi, Snickers, Kellogg’s Cornflakes, Milka Chocolate, Ritter Sport chocolate, Wrigley’s chewing gum, along with many other products ranging from mayonnaise to pet food have all been affected, though availability reportedly varies between supermarket chains.

      <description>Food Collapse:

Yara has now closed another European fertilizer plant - due to the cost of energy.

Yara’s site in Wallonia has been offline from 15 September. It is no longer financially viable to make fertiliser in Europe, given that natural gas is key to the process.

They aren’t alone. Steel producers, yarn factories, are all shutting down…

      <description>Undersea cable CUT to Shetland, communications down.

I’d warned once pipelines started blowing up that undersea cables would be the next bit of critical infrastructure to be targeted - here we go.

- Get hard copies of materials you need
- Write down critical radio frequencies for your family/group, nearby repeaters
- Know where and HOW to get information if comms go out

Are they trying to convince people that they can’t rely on their memories? Is this the ultimate goal of psyop?

      <description>Undersea cables damaged to cut communications ? More predictive media around this from US Naval Institute:

Repairing Submarine Cables Is a Wartime Necessity

Options to repair underseas fiber-optic cables in the event of war or sabotage are limited.

“What should the U.S. do when the transoceanic submarine fiber optic cables that supply, at the speed of light, more than 99 percent of the international voice, data, video, and internet communications between the United States and the rest of the world are damaged or cut during wartime?

Declare an emergency? Then what?”

      <description>“Many agrifood sectors are now  controlled by just four to six dominant firms, enabling these companies to wield enormous influence over markets, agricultural research and policy-development, which undermines food sovereignty.

2020 was a horrific year for food security and health – but a bonanza for Big Food and Big Ag. Food Barons made the most of the converging crises in order to tighten their grip on every link in the Industrial Food Chain. In doing so, they undermine the rights of peasants, smallholders, fishers and pastoralists to produce food for their own communities and many others.

The Food Barrons are accelerating digitalization of food and agriculture across the chain in order to hold on to, naturalize and expand their power, despite their many failings.

It’s time to divest from the Industrial Food Chain.”

Although they arent critical of climate hoax, the analysis of multinational companies seeking to control is worthwhile - full report:  https://www.etcgroup.org/sites/www.etcgroup.org/files/files/food-barons-2022-full_sectors-final_16_sept.pdf</description>

      <description>Good piece : BIG VEGANISM is cover for corporate takeover of food production!

“Multinationals love the phrase “plant-based” because it is a euphemism for the messianic, cultish, modish cause they have adopted: veganism.”

Some of the alt-protein research in Food Valley is directed towards consuming insects (“entomophagy”); some is more focused on algae, fungi — or mycobacterial this, that and the other. But the big research bucks are flowing one way only, and that is to plant-based alternatives to meat.

      <description>Power down? Try salt curing for a low-electricity alternative

Power cuts, rationing or sky-high energy prices? Who knows what this season will hold. Cooking without power may sound apocalyptic, but there are plenty of ways to get creative in the kitchen, all while keeping electricity use to a minimum.

One alternative is to cure food with salt.

From a chemical point of view, salt also has hygroscopic properties. When in contact with moist food, salt has the ability to absorb the water contained in the food. And it is this phenomenon that is interesting to note when it comes to cutting power use.

      <description>The BASF keystone:  as goes the gas, so goes BASF, so goes Germany, so goes Europe . . .

"Everything is connected at the German chemical firm BASF’s Ludwigshafen site, a 10 sq km industrial complex so large that byproducts from making ammonia, for example, are funnelled through a 1,771-mile pipe network to produce fertiliser, disinfectant, diesel exhaust fluid, or CO2 for fizzy drinks.

The plant is a giant integrated process — and it cannot run without a supply of natural gas.

“Once we can receive &lt; 50% of our maximum requirements, we would need to wind down the entire site,” says a  spokesperson.

The consequences of a BASF shutdown would be far-reaching, not just in Germany but the entire continent.

BASF-produced chemicals are used to make anything from toothpaste to vitamins, [and animal feed]. It's a top manufacturer of painkillers, and its largest customer industry is the automobile industry [— and AdBlue, which is required to run diesel engines, and keep trucking running ... ].

      <description>The media is now blaming an outbreak of varroa mites for food prices in Australia.

( by the way there are natural solutions for varroa - see @iaf_bees for beekeeper chat ! )

__
AUS: Varroa mite to impact grocery prices

Over 12,000 honeybee hives have been destroyed since the mite was detected at the Port of Newcastle in June.

The first 100 days of the outbreak have already cost the economy over $63 million.

      <description>Top notch interview with Gabe Brown on regenerative methods to cultivate awesome soil which can't help but grow amazing amounts of food for your family!

——

Gabe Brown on Regenerative Solutions to Modern Problems – Ice Age Farmer Podcast

Gabe Brown of Browns Ranch — a pioneer of the soil-health movement and regenerative practices — joins Christian to discuss regenerative practices and soil health as the bottom line solutions to the myriad problems we face. We discuss the Covid19 pandemic and what we can learn from it, how healthy living soil helped Brown’s Ranch weather the difficult, cold and wet 2019 season in North Dakota — and can do the same for you! Producers from homesteaders/gardeners to larger farmer ranchers can start improving their operations immediately without huge capital investment. Gabe also describes how they have actually been getting a boost in sales due to their direct-to-market approach. And of course we describe the 6 rules for building amazing soil and growing lots of food!

      <description>"Protein from CO2" is not just technocratic rhetoric babble.  It is highly funded:

We've created the world's first air chicken and air scallops. Turning elements in the air into sustainable protein that eliminates compromise between taste, nutrition, and climate threat.
We're on track to craft our protein flour into delicious and nutritious chicken, beef, pork, and seafood made from air that are better for the planet and your plate.

      <description>"Not all food will be available in the future."

Swedish 'food expert' describes the "Food Transformation" we are living through using the same language as the WEF / EAT/Lancet / UN:

"The most central thing in human life, food, is undergoing a huge transformation right now and thinking about what will be on our plates and how it got there is exciting to say the least.

..."Alternative proteins such as insects, lab-grown meat and new technologies such as producing proteins from carbon dioxide and water will be a complement on our plates in 18 years but not be the main source of protein. "

      <description>More food infrastructure burning - Canadian bridge causes grains transport issues:

“An entire economy is relying on these little ribbons of steel through Canada'

A bridge burned down on the Canadian National Railway Co. line, about 95 kilometres to the south, severing the only rail link in or out of Grande Prairie and causing backlogs for the grain shippers who depend on that track to get their product to port.

CN said the severed line only moves a fraction of the total grain coming off fields in Western Canada. But for grain farmers and exporters, the bridge fire was another example of the fragility of the national supply lines that connect one of the world’s most important bread baskets with seaports and global markets.

Chicago wheat rose over 4% on Monday on concerns a flare-up in the Russia-Ukraine conflict could create new threats to grain shipments from the Black Sea region

Corn rose on expectations of smaller crops in the U.S. and Europe.

Welcome to the WEF's "post animal economy":

"A new animal-free milk promising to be more sustainable than dairy but with near-identical taste and nutritional content could hit supermarket shelves in the next two years, adding to the growing roster of milk alternatives available to Australian consumers."

      <description>Hey. What did you do TODAY to make yourself more RESILIENT for TOMORROW?

Have you been DOOMSCROLLING — or are you ACTIVELY investing in a de-centralized future: seed saving (food production), networking (community), energy systems (minimally solar+inverter+hot plate to cook!)

Lots to do - use these moments wisely!

      <description>Force majeure declarations have begun due to barges stopped in Mississippi due to low water levels

This affects not just the grains harvest, but fertilizer applications.

A logjam of ships, tugboats and barges due to low water levels on the Mississippi River is threatening to grind trade of grains, fertilizer and other goods to a halt, Bloomberg reports. Ingram Barge Company, the largest U.S. barge operator, declared force majeure in a letter to customers due to “near-historic” low water conditions on the Mississippi River. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Coast Guard said there was a queue of 122 vessels at Stack Island and 15 vessels at Memphis. Due to increased groundings, the number of vessels in tow is being restricted.

      <description>Unbelievable - Terrible timing to not be able to export grains/oilseeds:

U.S. barge backlog swells on parched Mississippi River

Commercial barge traffic on southern stretches of the Mississippi River was at a standstill on Tuesday as low water levels halted shipments of grain, fertilizer and other commodities on the critical waterway, shipping sources said.

The supply chain snarl comes just as harvesting of corn and soybeans, the largest U.S. cash crops, is ramping up and as tight global supplies and strong demand for food and fuel have sent inflation soaring.

Around 100 tow boats hauling some 1,600 barges were lined up for miles waiting to pass through one trouble spot near Lake Providence, Louisiana, that has been largely closed since late last week, shipping sources said.

At least two other sections of the lower Mississippi have also been closed at times, disrupting the flow of grain to U.S. Gulf Coast export terminals, where some 60% of U.S. corn, soybean and wheat exports exit the country, they said.

Shippers have been loading less cargo per barge so vessels sit higher on the water, and towing companies have reduced the number of barges per tow by nearly 40% as the low water conditions narrowed the navigable channel.

      <description>Dolphins, skunks, foxes now apparently have #BirdFlu as well — Remember : the agenda is “animals are dirty and dangerous and we must separate MAN from NATURE into the SmartCities!”

In Maine, an elevated number of gray and harbor seal deaths have been attributed to the disease, while in Florida, officials believe a bottle-nosed dolphin succumbed to the virus. It's also been detected in skunks and foxes.

After proliferating globally, a historic wave of avian flu has entered Southern California, where it is worrying farmers and bird lovers and could add to complications with supply chains and food prices.

In late August, one New Jersey park had to close its trails to hikers. There were too many dead vultures on the ground.

      <description>STUDY: Gates-funded Impossible Burger poisons rats

Rats fed GM yeast-derived protein soy leghemoglobin – the Impossible Burger’s key ingredient – showed signs of toxicity.

If you recall, the FDA at first hesitated about this GMO "heme" to make the Gates-funded thing "bleed," but when Whole Foods was purchased by Bezos, they sold it without FDA approval. The FDA approved soon thereafter.

Reject the synthetic food — grow your garden.

      <description>Brazilian soybean processors have halted operations as crushing margins turned negative.

Abiove, a trade group representing global oilseed crushers in Brazil, confirmed the move, telling Reuters some of its members advanced scheduled maintenance stoppages that traditionally happen at the end of the year as soyoil prices dropped while soybean prices remained high, hurting margins.

      <description>Vegetable/legume company HAK STOPS production for 6 weeks starting 2023. Energy prices make it infeasible to produce, says the market leader best known for the glass jars of applesauce, peas and brown beans.

"It is not only the high price, but also the uncertainty, says director Timo Hoogeboom. "Today it is two euros for a cubic meter of gas, it used to be three euros. We don't know what it will be in January or February. So to be on the safe side, we will remain closed."

If it is no longer possible to pass on the higher energy prices to consumers, the availability of products may ultimately also be compromised. "If companies have to sell below cost for months, things go wrong." He does not expect any empty shelves for HAK for the time being. "But I don't rule it out for the chain, especially in January, February and March." A temporary energy ceiling for companies could help, the HAK director thinks.

"Companies will first look at how they can absorb the costs themselves, but if that is no longer possible, they will have to scale down," confirms food economist Morren. "I expect this to happen more widely."

      <description>Netherlands: greenhouses and growers increasingly shutting down operations due to energy prices.  Those greenhouses accounted for nearly 40% of veg in Europe...

Video opens with a business owner heating her store with candles/terracotta:  "I lost my customers with COVID, and now inflation is so high people don't have money to buy children's clothes."

The elderly person with candle/terracotta heater is, to me, iconic of the strangulation that is gripping Europe in this engineered energy crisis.

      <description>French refinery strikes takes half of the nation’s refining capacity offline - forcing France’s largest sugar maker, Tereos, to curtail production

Diesel and petrol stations in France are running out of fuel, according to an industry union, as a refining strike takes its toll. The strike, which among others, took Total’s 240,000 bpd Gonfreville refinery offline as well as a couple of Exxon’s, was expected to conclude on Thursday…but Friday, reports came in that strikes were disrupting Total’s oil products refining and delivery for a fourth day — 60% of the nation’s total refining capacity.

“There is no need to rush to the station (for gas),” TotalEnergies said on Friday. Despite those affirmations, France’s largest sugar maker, Tereos, said it had to curtail production somewhat at some of its factories after Total advised it that it would not be able to supply it with any more diesel until the end of the week.

France was already battling a shortage of refined products, with Russia’s exports to Europe “falling” in recent months.

      <description>Bernese farmer’s 20 cows provide electricity and heat for several houses -- via biogas

Niklaus Hari converts manure and urine from his 20 cows into energy via a small biogas plant, providing electricity AND HEAT for several houses and a development.  “The main thing,” he says, “is we need the cows for their [manure].”

This is ANOTHER reason the WEF is so eager to reach the “Post Animal Economy” — only takes a small number of livestock to provide meat, dairy, and manure for fertilizer and energy.

To take control over FOOD, FERTILIZER, and ENERGY, they must eliminate animals from homesteads.

      <description>Hurricane Ian's damage to Florida fertilizer plant creates 'concern' about rising food prices

Hurricane Ian forced Florida fertilizer maker Mosaic Co. to halt operations across Polk County for an unspecified amount of time as disaster relief efforts get underway.

The company’s North American phosphate operations make up "approximately 50 percent of North American farmers’ supply of granular phosphate fertilizer, and 12 percent of the global supply" in a given year.

      <description>Hurricane Ian is poised to strike at the nation’s production of phosphate fertilizer, threatening supply as the cost of growing food in the US rises by the most ever.

“Florida is home to Mosaic Co.’s phosphate rock assets, where they mine product, and to facilities where they turn that rock into fertilizers like diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate, commonly known as DAP and MAP.

“Mosaic’s New Wales plant is ‘right in the middle of the damage swath,’ said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. It could ‘be out for weeks,’ he said in an email.”

      <description>German producers warn of food shortages

“Act now – otherwise the refrigerators and freezers of the German population will soon be empty,”

Manufacturers of both frozen and fresh products say they cannot cope with soaring energy costs

“There are significant supply gaps in the daily food supply for people in Germany. The situation is more than serious,” an open letter from the industry said.

“Companies now fear that production lines will soon come to a standstill and that refrigerated logistics centers for food distribution will be closed. Some are even preparing for possible insolvency.”

The irony here is rich (“FAKE MEAT EXEC EATS MAN!”) but the bigger crime remains BeyondMeat’s goal of ending ranching and animal homesteading, and telling kids their parents don’t love them if they feed them meat, and “just don’t understand” that fake meat is friendlier to the planet.

Beyond is a criminal organization funded by criminal Gates and they are the enemy of humanity.

And they eat noses.

      <description>USDA investing $2.8 billion in ‘climate-smart’ agriculture

The rhetoric:
“There is strong and growing interest in the private sector and among consumers for food that is grown in a climate-friendly way”

The reality:
Riceland Foods is one of the company’s receiving funding. $20 million from the USDA to create a farmer-friendly [😂] system to support adoption of climate-smart practices and interact with commodity buyers in climate-smart markets.”

BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
“Riceland will build a farmer-focused asset registry system for data collection, benefit quantification, verification and farmer compensation.”

SO IT’S A TRACKING SYSTEM—perfect awareness of all resources. Agenda 2030 style. Just slap “farmer friendly” and “climate smart” on it instead of calling it what it is: total surveillance of food production.

USDA conducting #WarOnFarms.

      <description>France to reap worst corn harvest in decades

French farmers are harvesting their smallest corn crop in more than three decades, following the worst drought in at least 500 years that has hit the continent.

The smaller crops in France, which is one of Europe’s agricultural heavyweights, could drive soaring food prices even higher. Fields in Germany and Romania, other key EU producers, have also suffered from drought.

(Cue the media blaming climate change and calls for zero carbon)

      <description>ALERT - the USDA wants you to REGISTER YOUR GARDEN.  Their "people's garden" program is NOT your grandma's victory garden brochure. It is—in their own words—creating a registry and map of small-scale food production.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES REGISTER YOUR GARDEN.  No matter what benefits or enticements are offered.
—
"The USDA expanding its People’s Garden Initiative to include eligible gardens nationwide!

"School gardens, community gardens, urban farms, and small-scale agriculture projects in rural, suburban and urban areas can be recognized as a “People’s Garden” if they register on the USDA website and meet criteria including benefiting the community, working collaboratively, incorporating conservation practices and educating the public. Affiliate People’s Garden locations will be indicated on a map on the USDA website, featured in USDA communications, and provided with a People’s Garden sign.

      <description>Europe’s Natural Gas Shortage Could Trigger A Food Crisis

Governments are using every tool in their kits to curb the rising inflation rates, there’s far less they can do about the coming food shortage.

"Countries can't mandate fertilizer production because they are so worried about having enough natural gas to heat people's homes," John Harpole, a natural gas broker for the fertilizer sector told Newsweek. "They are having to choose between future food production and heat and they are going to choose heat."

The problem with an energy crisis is that it’s actually an everything crisis. In a world where virtually every industry relies on energy in some form, runaway inflation is an inevitability.

      <description>France bracing for ‘catastrophic’ food shortages and price hikes following drought, farmers and unions warn

After four severe heatwaves this year record high temperatures have wreaked havoc on crops and could have a devastating impact on the availability of food across the rest of Europe.

France is the leading European exporter of potatoes with more than two million tonnes of the crop being exported each year.

Food producers say nearly 1.5 million tonnes of potato crops could be lost due to the heatwave — a drop of 20 per cent.

Geoffroy d’Evry, a farmer in the Oise region and president of potato-growers’ union UNPT, said: “We have never experienced a situation like this.

“We were preparing to spend the winter without heating or electricity, and now we discover that there may not even be potatoes for dinner?”  [Welcome to the Great Reset — this is why we prepared.]

The Legumes de France federation has also estimated losses of between 25 and 35 per cent of the production and yield of vegetables.

      <description>Supermarket Asda has introduced a budget line of products, only to limit purchases thereof to three per customer.

This is actually similar to to the Iranian scheme of subsidizing only a few items a week — everyone is free to purchase as much EXPENSIVE food as you want (can), but for those of us swept up in the intentional economic devastation, well, you only get three packs of affordable vegan hot dogs, slave.

Remember: Rockefellers called for Food as UBI, declaring that “food is a human right.”

      <description>Russia promises to provide FREE fertilizer and increased grain exports to “poor countries” — this has been under- [un-] reported in western media:
_

Russia is set to ramp up grain exports, seeking to supply some 30 million tons this year, President Vladimir Putin has announced. The supplies will prioritize less well off and food-insecure nations.

“We believe it to be right to ramp up deliveries to the poorest countries,” Putin said during a meeting of the Security Council on Friday.

“In total, by the end of this year, we will supply some 30 million tons of grain and are ready to increase this volume to 50 million tons or more, because, thank God, we have a good harvest this year,” he added.

Moscow is also ready to supply fertilizers to the poorest nations free of charge, the Russian president said. “Our producers — we’re talking about potash fertilizers – are ready to deliver them free of charge to developing nations that urgently need them,” Putin said, instructing the Russian Foreign Ministry to work on the plan.

      <description>Another mass kill of livestock:  57,000 cows perish in India - milk shortages and "hundreds of carcasses of dead cows have been found lying in the open, causing a nauseating stench, with crows and vultures feeding on them."

Media asking "Why" — some farmers suggesting the cows were recently vaxxed against Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD).

"Pictures taken with the help of drone cameras reveal a large number of carcasses spread over several square kilometre area. In some places, it is even difficult to keep a count of those dead."

      <description>Ohio: another 3 million chickens euthanized due to claimed #BirdFlu - one of the largest egg laying operations in US

An outbreak of bird flu that has led to the deaths of 43 million chickens and turkeys this year across the U.S. has been found at a giant egg-laying operation in Ohio, state and federal agriculture officials said Wednesday.

The case confirmed over the weekend in Ohio’s Defiance County has affected roughly 3 million chickens, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The egg-laying farm has started euthanizing all of its flock, said Dennis Summers, the state’s veterinarian.

      <description>World’s largest rice exporter restricts shipments

India has banned sending broken rice abroad and imposed a 20% duty on other varieties.

The South Asian nation cited food security concerns in making the move, which was announced on Thursday, as below-average monsoon rainfall had curtailed planting. India exports rice to more than 150 countries.

IceAgeFarmer note: this is the “food nationalism” that was described by Podesta’s Food Chain Reaction Game leading to massive geopolitical instability and hunger

UN Food Official Warns Fertilizer Affordability Crisis Could Slash Global Grain Production By 40%

Global fertilizer shortages threaten to starve a planet as prices are too high for some farmers ahead of the next planting season. 

That's the view of Maximo Torero, chief economist from the Food &amp; Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), who told Bloomberg TV that elevated fertilizer prices could decrease global grain production by upwards of 40% in the next planting season.

@iceagefarmer comment: I’ve mentioned so frequently that as net exporters move to protect their domestic stocks/prices, net importers are left empty handed — like Philippines here, resorting to confiscation of foodstuffs from private hands.

Sadly, we’ll see more of this in the days ahead.

      <description>Sugar and Salt Shortage Worsens Philippines Food Supply Woes

A top soft-drinks maker with no sugar, a burger joint out of onions and kitchens short of salt underscore the dependence of the Philippines on food imports and illustrate some of the cost  pressures fueling inflation.

The country not only buys sugar, salt and garlic from abroad, but also imports a raft of other food commodities such as rice, wheat, corn and soybean meal, and that’s after global farm prices surged to a record this year on the back of lower world supply caused by drought, heat and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

      <description>Biden/Trump have now mutually declared each other enemies of the state, within just the last days.

The stage is now set, and an extraordinarily dangerous show is about to begin. The USA likes to do things bigger and better, and this will be no exception.  Once this kicks off there will be no stopping it, and I expect escalation of crises and conflicts worldwide.

Keep your wits about you and continue moving away from the system, towards self-sufficiency in food, energy, medicine, local markets/currencies. Radical and rapid decentralization is the only way forward.

Comms will go down at some point.  I am grateful and honored to have shared this space with you.

Godspeed and God bless.

      <description>Yuval Harari echoes the WEF claims that meat is “unsustainable” and we must end farming and ranching:

Yuval Noah Harari, historian, futurist, and World Economic Forum (WEF) adviser, described “cultured meat” synthesized in laboratories as more “ecological” and “ethical” than meat from animal husbandry and slaughter.

      <description>The USDA has stopped providing export data.

They declined to indicate why.

They neglected to provide a timeline for when this may be available again.

Regardless of the presumably forthcoming excuse, this is effectively an act of warfare as markets (domestic AND foreign) are now blind to what is going/coming from the US.

UPDATE: they now indicate there is an issue migrating to a new reporting system that should be resolved by mid september.  Interesting date given futures contracts…

      <description>Fire at Biggest US Midwest Refinery Threatens Fuel Supplies

An outage at the largest US Midwest refinery is raising wholesale fuel prices regionally just as the agricultural sector gears up for its busiest time of year.

BP shut two crude units at its 435,000 barrel-a-day Whiting, Indiana, refinery after a fire Wednesday, Wood Mackenzie’s Genscape said. The fire occurred in the power house and caused a loss of cooling water, which could lead to damaged equipment, according to a person familiar with operations.

*** A prolonged shutdown of the plant, which supplies gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to most of the region’s major distribution centers, could tighten fuel markets just as farmers in the nation’s breadbasket prepare for harvesting season. ***

@iceagefarmer note: just another coincidence I’m sure.  Nothing to see here…

      <description>UK: Asda drops expiration dates on food.

@iceagefarmer note: I’d mentioned just two weeks ago that removing expiration dates from food was part of the EU “Farm to Fork” and Rockefeller “Reset the Table” discussions — and now we see it rolling out!

But, this is just a small change compared to the major changes coming for food #retail.

      <description>Aluminum producer Speira GmbH is considering cutting production at its German smelter to 50% of total capacity in response to surging energy costs that are squeezing power-intensive industries across Europe. The curtailment would add to the extreme toll that the energy crisis is having on Europe’s metals industry, which is one of the biggest industrial consumers of power and gas. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-23/german-aluminum-smelter-considers-halving-output-on-energy-costs#xj4y7vzkg</description>

      <description>Even more concerning than 50% crop loss, is that farmers are already blowing through their winter animal feed.  Clearly this means that by mid-winter, there will be no animal feed.  Which means come late winter, unless things change somehow, there will be no livestock.

"To make matters worse, livestock farmers in the region are also now struggling, with many being forced to give animals feed meant to be kept for the winter as the amount of edible grass on the ground quite literally has dried up.

"Fodder that might otherwise be imported from Russia or Ukraine is proving hard to come by as a result of the former’s invasion the latter and the West’s resulting sanctions war with Moscow..."

      <description>Germany:  50% crop loss due to drought in some regions

Up to half of the crops in parts of the German state of Baden-Württemberg are likely to be lost due to drought, farmers in the region have claimed, with problems to do with the prices of fuel, fertiliser, and pesticides connected to the green agenda and war in Ukraine also reportedly causing problems for those in the region

The serious lack of rainfall has led farmers to fear that the likes of maize, sugar beet, potato, and soybean crops could see losses of up to 50%.

      <description>POLAND: People are sleeping in their car just to stay in line for coal to heat their homes.

We can joke, "Thanks a lot Greta" but this is a serious situation and the complete collapse of Europe.  I can't believe that people aren't more upset with EU leadership at the self-imposed, utter destruction of energy supply, food supply, economy, livelihoods.  Perhaps once more people FEEL the pain this winter, we enter Klaus Schwab's "angrier world..."

      <description>India has banned wheat exports to protect domestic prices.

Here's why this is a really big deal as we enter full on #FoodWars.  Top wheat producers are being hit across the board:

#1  China.  (also #1 consumer!)
#2  India.  (and now exports are banned.)
#3  Russia (#1 exporter — but Black Sea shipping is affected, and sanctions stop some buyers)
#4  USA (terrible season, drought)
#5  France (drought has severely impacted yields)
#6  Canada (spotty harvest so far)
#7  Germany (drought  has severely impacted yields)
#10 Ukraine

It is these nations that the rest of the world upon for their bread.  And bear in mind some major wheat exporters like Kazakhstan have banned wheat/flour exports.  Supplies are getting tight and countries are acting defensively.  No relief in sight as harvests are looking bad across Northern hemisphere and things are off to poor start in S. America.

Stock up and keep growing food!
