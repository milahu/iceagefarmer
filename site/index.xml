A spectacular fire demolished M &amp; E Seed and Grain Co. in Prosser and left one person with burns.

A few firefighters remained at the scene to monitor the fire.

Iran is set to be the first country to roll out a food rationing scheme based on new biometric IDs.  Where vaccine passports failed, food passports will now be eagerly accepted by hungry people who can't afford rapidly inflating food prices.  This is the realization of a longstanding agenda by the Rockefeller/UN/WEF crowd to, as Kissinger put it, "control food, and control people."  Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

A federal judge told Miller to cease and desist all meat sales, and sent armed U.S. marshals to search his property, farm store and freezers. They took an inventory of all his meat to make sure he doesn’t sell any or slaughter anymore animals.

Last summer, the judge also ordered Miller to pay $250,000 for “contempt of court,” and said he will also have to pay the salaries of the USDA investigators assigned to his case, $50,000 of which was due last week as a “good faith” payment to avoid jail.

Shoppers warned the price of fresh fruit and vegetables will rise after latest rain event

Farmers who risked planting after the February deluge lost entire crops and face financial ruin after the second deluge.

Lockyer Valley’s mayor, Tanya Milligan, said crops were rotting in the ground and 90% of insurance claims have been rejected.

“A lot of those farmers were hoping and depending on that (insurance payout),” Milligan said.

“We will have farmers that have no intention to replant. You have people that have just lost absolutely everything and they will be wondering is it all worth it?

Soaring bread prices spark protests and shop fires in Iran

Soaring bread prices have triggered protests in Iran in which some shops were set on fire, prompting police to arrest scores of "provocateurs"

The protests were triggered by a cut in government subsidies for imported wheat that caused price hikes as high as 300 percent for a variety of flour-based staples.

Iran’s official inflation rate is around 40%, and some estimate it is over 50%. Almost half Iran’s 82 million population are now below the poverty line.

The government plans to offer digital coupons in the next couple of months for limited amounts of bread at subsidised prices. The rest will be offered at market rates. Other food items will be added later.

The European Union on Monday told Italy to establish an infected zone for African swine fever in areas of Rome and implement special control measures to stop it spreading.

    It said Italy must "ensure that consignments of porcine animals kept in the areas listed as an infected zone... and products thereof are not authorised for movements to other Member States and to third countries".

    The government plans to cull wild boar, after several cases of swine fever were detected in Rome and with the animals becoming increasingly brazen about their encroachments into residential areas as they forage, especially in the capital.

    The Rome cases, which rose to six Friday, are the first outside the area of the original outbreak in Liguria and Piedmont.

    The authorities said two more cases were found in Liguria on Monday, taking the total for that region and Piedmont up to 119.

    The Coldiretti farm group said some 2.1 million boar needed to be culled in Italy as "a real risk to public safety". (ANSA).

[IAF: This purchase was pending before India announced their ban — will be interesting to see price point.]

Egypt has four months' worth of strategic at reserves and six months of vegetable oils, the country's prime minister said earlier in the day.

Egypt, one of the world's biggest wheat importers, is looking for alternatives to Black Sea grain exports which face disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, both major wheat exporters to Egypt.

India Bans Wheat Exports in Growing Wave of Food Protectionism

India prohibited wheat exports that the world was counting on to alleviate supply constraints sparked by the war in Ukraine, saying that the nation’s food security is under threat. 
Exports will still be allowed to countries that require wheat for food security needs and based on the requests of their governments. All other new shipments will be banned with immediate effect.

Supply chain issues continue to create logistical problems, and a Tennessee farmer says it all depends on what he needs.

David Nichols says it hasn’t been easy.  “But so far we’ve been able to keep crop protection products, the chemistry side of things, in-house,” he says.  Nichols, who farms in south Tennessee, tells Brownfield parts are a different story. “I have a neighbor who has a turbocharger issue and they can’t source one,” he says.  “It’s been a national type search for it and it’s just not there.  We’re still seeing those supply issues impact us.”

Nichols says he’s about a month behind his typical planting pace, and is hopeful he can play catchup this week.

Kiev cites "force majeure" to halt a third of Russian transited gas flow to Europe, while Gazprom says there have been no issues that would justify the move.

Gas from this connection will not be accepted into the transit system of Ukraine starting at 7 am on Wednesday, OGTSU said. Sokhrankovka accounts for almost a third of the Russian gas that transits through Ukraine to Europe – up to 32.6 million cubic meters per day – according to the operators.

[IAF:  German energy ministers confirm their supply is as low as 2-3 weeks.  Keep an eye on Europe.]

Russian gas conglomerate Gazprom has received no confirmation of force majeure or any obstacles to continued transit of gas through a junction in Lugansk Region, the company said on Tuesday, after Ukraine’s operator OGTSU announced it would halt further deliveries starting May 11, due to the presence of “Russian occupiers.”

Gas Transit Services of Ukraine (OGTSU) declared force majeure on Tuesday, saying that it was impossible to continue the transit of gas through a connection point and compressor station located in the Lugansk area.

Nearly 25 million tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine, says UN food agency

Nearly 25 million tonnes of grains are stuck in Ukraine and unable to leave the country due to infrastructure challenges and blocked Black Sea ports including Mariupol, a U.N. food agency official said on Friday.

“It’s an almost grotesque situation we see at the moment in Ukraine with nearly 25 mln tonnes of grain that could be exported but that cannot leave the country simply because of lack of infrastructure, the blockade of the ports,” Josef Schmidhuber, FAO Deputy Director, Markets and Trade Division told a Geneva press briefing via Zoom.

Schmidhuber said the full silos could result in storage shortages during the next harvest in July and August.

Head of the WTO announced, “It would really help the world if we could evacuate this grain (from Ukraine),” — Earlier this week, the head of the World Trade Organization told Reuters she was “seriously worried” about spiraling food prices and seeking solutions alongside other partners.

Like the Canadian fishers and all the other food producers that have been regulated or shutdown since 2020 - in many cases there are fights going on in the courts. But what’s more significant is that all these legal battles flow from a calculated wave of shutdowns in disparate areas and industries,  happening in concert, in a year while everyone was confused. 

They shook up the nest and then threw a web over producers around the world.

We went from “India will step in to cover the Ukraine wheat” to new export limits in about a month.  

This is huge. With other major exporters already limiting, Black Sea not shipping, US having worst wheat since ‘89, China worst on record - this really signals the “protectionist” policies (ie keep our food domestic!) will now spread everywhere. And importers are in real trouble.

An observing alien species would ask itself, "Why is humanity destroying ALL of their food sources?"  In this special Ice Age Farmer broadcast, Christian has a candid conversation about the overwhelming number of attacks on our food supply and animals.  With crops unplanted and with more food facilities burning down, the media runs stories about "food fire conspiracy theories."  And it's not just chickens -- the state is also killing deer and fish in the name of stopping diseases.  Start growing food now.

Should people be limited in how much they can spend per week on carbon-intensive purchases? CBDCs could help with that too,” N.S.

Experts say Japanese encephalitis will impact pork supply as infected piggeries experience production losses of up to 80 per cent.  There are now 30 New South Wales piggeries affected by the mosquito-borne virus and 11 people have been infected, with three deaths nationwide.

"It's also the mental health impact on the people, because there's been a lot of stillborn or abortions or abnormalities in piglets … which can be very stressful seeing … day in, day out."

The disease has no impact on the safety of consuming pork, but Dr Britton said production losses were likely to affect availability.

"I think it will affect the supply of pork, because it has impacted a number of the bigger properties as well as some of the smaller ones," she said.

As the engineered food crisis has gained traction in mainstream awareness, I started writing a pamphlet/book with the purpose of helping to shepherd people out of the grocery store and into growing food as part of an emergent, decentralized food system.

The book is a run through the most important things I've learned through years of conversations about food sovereignty, in a context of immediately standing up systems to endure (and fight) the technocratic takeover of food.  "Assume crash position!"

I wanted to share this news early, rather than be too quiet the new project.  If you are interested in the book or have any thoughts on what belongs in a "victory garden lightning course," I'd love to hear from you!  Drop a comment or email.

Warmly,
Christian

“A bumper crop is needed.”

The cold temps and excessive rains have kept farmers out of the fields, delaying planting.  When considered also with fertilizer and other input shortages … a bumper crop can not be expected, to say the least.

Sadly, the increasing food prices and availability issues we see today are only a tease of what is ahead.

Iowa’s spring planting season continues to be delayed, now falling well behind recent years and the five-year average after several rounds of heavy rain and severe weather prevented many from getting into the fields over the warmer weekend.

Average 4-inch soil temperatures remain below the 50-degree target to begin planting corn in Northern Iowa, and while southern and southeast Iowa have finally warmed up, planting is only just getting underway.

Monday’s crop progress report from the USDA didn’t even put a percentage on amount of acres planted through April 24th. For comparison, in 2021, 20 percent of Iowa’s corn crop was already in the ground at this point, with 27 percent in the ground in North Central Iowa, where soil temperatures and growing degree days are well short of targets. Even more starkly, even last year’s 20 percent progress still fell a day behind the 5-year average.

Now, as the calendar is set to turn to May, more rain in the forecast could continue to frustrate farmers, even in areas where ground temperatures have finally hit acceptable levels. Showers and storms on Saturday could bring another soaking rain with widespread totals potentially at an inch or more, with even more rain and storms possible in the long term, arriving Tuesday or Wednesday next week.

RAIN CONTINUES TO DELAY PLANTING

While eighty-degree temperatures over the weekend warmed up southern Illinois soils, frequent rains are still causing planting delays.

For some farmers in the region, including Lance Panzer of Waltonville, the answer to how much planting they have done is, “None whatsoever.”

He tells Brownfield their tillage equipment and planters are hooked up and ready to roll, but “Just about the time we are ready to go, every five days it seems to rain again and that’s how it has been all spring. And every time it rains you can reset the clock another 7 days.”

He says they really need seven days without rain before soils are dry enough for planting, and looking at data from his on-farm trials, he will be concerned if they cannot get some seed in the ground by May 10th.

“After we get past the 10th of May, we are shaving yield off of both beans and corn.”

Freeze warnings in southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois might delay planting for farmers, gardeners

“Planting corn seeds won’t begin until May, but the cold weather might push it back if this weather continues,” said Jordan Schuler, the regional crops educator with UW Extension. Schuler’s region includes Rock and Jefferson counties in Wisconsin.

“I was told that the soil temperature is around 48 degrees, and farmers like it to be around 50 to 55 degrees,” Cain said. “The seeds won’t germinate until the soil gets warm enough.”

The BBC not even bothering to decorate the propaganda, echoing nearly verbatum the the EAT-Lancet commission. “Food is the single strongest lever to optimize human health and environmental sustainability on Earth.”

__

Dining on the likes of lab-grown meat or ground-up insects could lead to big savings in carbon emissions and water, as well as freeing up land for nature.

Scientists say pressures on the planet could fall by more than 80% with such foods, compared with the typical European diet.

They say switching meat, dairy and other animal products for alternative foods could reduce these impacts by more than 80%, while providing a more complete range of essential nutrients than a purely vegetarian or vegan diet.

Materials including starch, packaging, fats, and oils were the most challenging for General Mills to find, affecting the multinational brand's pizza, hot snacks, cereal, and refrigerated baked goods.  Part of the issue is a global supply shortage resulting from the war in Ukraine, which has put additional strain on oils and starch. Those two ingredients are usually made of wheat—which is heavily exported by Russia and Ukraine. Both countries are halting sending resources out right now.

IAF comment:  these fires are now at ridiculous levels.  Our food supply is spontaneously combusting at ludicrous speed.

By that I mean this:  it is now reaching a level of “Revelation of the Method,” where even Tucker is speaking about the destruction of our food supply, yet multiple large facilities continue to erupt in flames every day.

It is unbelievable, like the poorly constructed narratives of many false flags, such as paper passports being magically found after 9/11…

The fires become an outright mockery of those of us who are paying attention.  We are burning your food supply, and even telling you we're doing it, and you can't stop us!  

——  Ignore the mockery -- keep planting that garden. ——


“A large fire at a sausage factory is being tackled by 10 crews from both Essex and Hertfordshire. Thick plumes of smoke can be seen across the town and the fire service has warned people to stay indoors and keep windows shut.

The fire service said when crews arrived the building was 95% alight and 100% smoke-logged.

Diesel shortage may hit wheat harvesting and sowing of Kharif crops as farmers are queuing up at filling stations to get oil supplies in various areas of Punjab.

Reports particularly from south Punjab districts suggest that diesel is either not available or its supplies are short at filling stations. Farmers who have harvested wheat and are waiting for its threshing are worried that if diesel supplies are not stabilised, their crop may be damaged because of high winds and possible rains in the month of May.

Farmers from various regions blame panic buying for the shortage on the rumours that the oil prices may be increased from May 1. “Some of our colleagues are trying to hoard the oil in anticipation of an increase in its prices, putting stress on the supplies,” says Fayyaz from Chishtian.

“Canada’s emission intensity for cereals in 2017 is higher than those reported for the United States, the European Union and (other regions).”  The discussion paper includes a table, using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to emphasize that Canadian cereal crops produce the highest amount of nitrous oxide emissions in the developed world.

How does this make sense as food shortages are announced?  Only if it is deliberately making things worse.  We are under attack:

“Northern Ireland will need to lose more than 1 million sheep and cattle to meet its new legally binding climate emissions targets, according to an industry-commissioned analysis.

The large-scale reduction in farm animals comes after the passing of the ​​jurisdiction’s first ever climate act, requiring the farming sector to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reduce methane emissions by almost 50% over the same period.

    Zero Carbon = Zero Animals.  Hence the WEF’s “Post Animal Econoy”

[IAF: Biden’s USDA is also charged with zero emissions agriculture mandate]

“Food accounts for a third of man’s climate impact, but the figures available on this subject are very general. “And you can do a lot in eating habits,” says Schöne. Buying Dutch apples instead of Brazilian bananas immediately reduces your footprint significantly. “But that person needs to know how much CO2 emissions are associated with the product they’re buying.”

This is why the climate expert is calling on the firm to better map the products that cause the most emissions, so that consumers can make better choices and the data collected by Rabobank is more reliable.

The first European social credit system is being developed in Italy, which is controversial because of its similarities to China’s infamous social credit system. This application, already operating in Rome, gives reward points to citizens who have ‘good behavior.’ 

The so-called “Smart Citizen Wallet” system will reward people with points for things like recycling, using public transportation, managing energy well, and anything else that the state deems worthy of rewards.

Those who use the application and have what they call “virtuous behaviors” will be rewarded with gifts, such as discounts on purchases and services, cultural activities free of charge, etc., which are then redeemed for the points obtained. 

According to the local newspaper of Bologna, Corriere di Bologna, the application is voluntary. It will be launched this autumn in the northern Italian city while it is in its experimental stage in Rome.

Video report forthcoming. - @iceagefarmer

___
“The FBI is warning farmers of potential hackers targeting the ag industry.

The agency said cyber-criminals might be more likely to go after farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons.

Six grain companies were targeted last fall, and two others have already been attacked this year, authorities said.

A major disruption of grain production would impact the entire food chain, something criminals take advantage of when trying to extort growers.

I’m so glad this is catching people’s attention.  One thing to note:  it’s been going on for YEARS.  

Here is a map I’d created in 2020 when the suspicious fires at food processing plants started ticking up, and then it became impossible to keep up!  

You can click each pin to find a farm, or food distribution center, or warehouse, or grain elevator, or the port of Beirut going up in flames — and each whittles away the resilience of our food supply chain.

The 20 fires in the last 2 months here (which are not even on this map yet), while noteworthy, are just the latest acceleration!

Two people who are hospitalized in critical condition in mainland China have tested positive for H5N6 bird flu, raising the number of cases so far this year to 19, officials say. The spike in human cases has led to calls for increased surveillance.

The first case, a 28-year-old man from Puyang in Henan Province, developed symptoms on March 18 after exposure to live poultry, according to the Hong Kong Health Department. He was hospitalized the next day and remains in critical condition.

The other case, a 53-year-old woman from Zhenjiang City in Jiangsu Province, fell ill on March 24 after visiting a live poultry market. She was hospitalized two days later and is still in critical condition.

The Chinese government disclosed last month that a 12-year-old girl and a 79-year-old man died of H5N6 bird flu in December. Both lived in Liuzhou, a city in the Guangxi region, and visited a live poultry market before falling ill.

“… animals are dirty and dangerous …”

A Quebec duck-farming operation in the Eastern Townships says three of its facilities have been devastated by avian flu, forcing it to slaughter 150,000 birds and lay off nearly 300 employees.

It will likely take six to 12 months and possibly several million dollars to fully restore the company's operations, Angela Anderson of Brome Lake Ducks said in an interview Wednesday.

Latest example of spontaneous combustion of our food supply: see #fire tag:

The large fire at a potato processing plant in Belfast is expected to have ripple effects across Maine’s agriculture industry.

The Penobscot McCrum plant processed Maine-grown spuds into products sold around the country.

A fire tore through the building Thursday morning, destroying the facility and leaving the 138 people who work there without a job.

Don Flannery, executive director of the Maine Potato Board, said the loss of the plant will have a negative impact on the state’s potato growers. “There are producers across the state who have contracts with the plant who may need to make adjustments to their 2022 growing plans after the fire.

Taylor Farms is a major agriculture company that brings many of the salad kits seen in grocery stores and is a major employer.

"We are above and beyond the rate of spread, we saw in 2015. 
"Last time, 81 percent of the cases were in the fourth and fifth month, as things exploded. What chicken egg prices did last time affected the market for years.
