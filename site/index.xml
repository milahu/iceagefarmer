      <description>Should China own American farmland?

&gt; USDA’s latest data shows China owns over 191,000 acres of U.S. lands, but that was before a North Dakota land sale this Spring.

A Chinese company, Fufeng Group, recently acquired 300 acres in North Dakota for $2.6 million. According to the company, it intends to establish a milling plant.

German food banks suffer as former donors forced to become recipients

“People who used to be on the other side donating and helping us are now coming and asking for help," says Petra Lehmann, who heads the Heimatstern association. "We have lots of families now where it's impossible from one income to feed the family because it's so expensive."
This is also changing people's behaviors. "We buy more jars of cheap food," says Sertap. "It may be chicken. It could be fish, beans because they are more suitable for us."

Pensioner Katrin Obermeier has started rationing her food: "I'm using foods longer, especially past the expiration date because it is still well preserved."

[IceAgeFarmer note: this is true BUT remember that removal of date markings by end of 2022 was planned in the 2018 EU Farm to Fork agenda!! We are following the globalist food crisis scripts to a T!!]

The Rhine is causing French nuclear plants to shut down, German power plants to reduce output, and petroleum refineries to stop operating — and EU was already at its tipping point with Russian gas.

      <description>Borden Dairy Co. will immediately close its Alabama plant because “it could no longer support continued production,” according to a report.

Employees are being laid off. “Borden Dairy will close its Dothan, AL and Hattiesburg, MS milk production facilities by no later than September 30, 2022, and will no longer produce in these states,” according to the company’s statement.

IAF: the article neglects to mention that this flows from Blackrock imposing ESG scores that are killing dairy industry.

      <description>That sewer wastewater monitoring is sure turning out to be handy in the surveillance state.
__

Polio found in more wastewater samples in upstate New York’s Orange County

Wastewater samples taken from two different locations in Orange County in June and July tested positive for the virus, state officials told county leaders earlier this week.

The findings come days after the New York State Department of Health found similar evidence of community spread in sewage samples taken in neighboring Rockland despite no additional cases being reported.

State officials are urging anyone who is not vaccinated against the potentially life-threatening virus to get immunized after an unvaccinated adult in Rockland suffered paralysis and had to be hospitalized last month.

      <description>Greece rolls out digital ‘wallet’ for citizens; ID and driving license now on phone

[IAF: No doubt this is the kind of 'digital transformation' described for Ukraine as well... and everywhere...]

Greece has rolled out a mobile app that will replace the need to carry a police ID or a driver’s license in physical form, allowing faster transactions through a secure system calling for digital confirmation through a QR code, among others.

In addition, “We are creating a system for banks and telecom providers starting October 1, as well as for agencies requiring the user to show an ID. A digital trace will be created instead of copies of one’s ID, turning into digital proof something that has been a burden to provide in physical form,” the minister said, referring to the police IDs required for most official transactions.

      <description>The Solution To The Current Food Crisis Is Small And Local, Including Growing Food Locally.

Community currency expert Thomas Greco, author of “The End of Money,” maintains that a produce-backed currency could be issued without even creating a cryptocurrency. A group of local farmers could be organized to jointly issue farm currency as a paper or digital community currency, which could be spent into circulation to buy what the farmers needed to produce their crops. The currency would circulate in the local community and would be accepted back by the farmers in payment for the products they sell.

“So the currency has a beginning and an end, it’s created and it’s extinguished,” says Greco. “It’s created by the act of spending and it’s extinguished in the act of redemption, not in some other currency, but in goods and services that have been promised.”

IAF: Glad to see the discussion around local food systems AND new currencies outside CBs/CBDC — personally not a fan of using cryptos, so enjoyed these ideas and hope we can have those discussions]

      <description>Capitalismo vegano: multinacionales alimentarias y BlackRock

(Vegan Capitalism: Food Multinationals and BlackRock)
After seducing the population with the supposed wonders of the vegan diet, multinational meat companies and BlackRock/Vanguard have landed in the "alternative agriculture" sector

Although it may seem contradictory, the main transnational industrial meat production companies are the ones behind foods that, based on vegetables or proteins grown in laboratories, are presented as substitutes for meat, fish, eggs and milk.

[IAF: Yep, multinational food companies Nestle, Tyson, Smithfield, JBS are all working on fake meat — and many are WEF partners ! ]

American Heart Association study shows link between frequent naps and high blood pressure.

Frequent or usual daytime napping in adults was associated with a 24% high risk of having a stroke and a 12% higher risk of developing high blood pressure compared to never napping.

ARCHITECTING THE BEAST SYSTEM: AI Control of Food Supply

Forces are working to take total control of every drop of oil extracted from the ground, every fish caught from the sea, and every last bean harvested. It requires an immense technical infrastructure comprising 5G, blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence. This infrastructure has been built and is now being deployed, and we must understand that it is — in the very words of the Department of Defense — an AI weapons system. And that system is going live NOW. Christian breaks it down.

It is being marketed for safety (recalls) and peace of mind:

"Parents want to know, quite rightly, where ingredients they give to their baby have come from."

"...and so we at IBM/WEF developed a solution to replace natural abundance with techno-chains and smart packaging, only selling it to those who bow to our agenda!  Parents, your children will never know freedom, but at least you'll know where that Gogurt came from!"

      <description>All three Canadian Prairie Provinces say NO to Trudeau’s starvation policy [fight fight fight!!!]

The Prairie Provinces are in revolt, with the Premiers of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba unanimously rejecting Trudeau’s proposed fertilizer reduction policy.

In a letter to Justin Trudeau, Manitoba Premier Heather Stefanson had this to say about the proposed policy:

“Your government’s national emissions reduction targets are being brought forward at the worst possible time. They will negatively impact producer yields, which will mean higher grocery bills and less food security for families. This cannot be another blow to the affordability of raising a family in Manitoba.

Agricultural producers in Manitoba regarding the federal policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent from nutrient use by 2030. Their major concerns are unanimous. This policy would lower their crop yields and decrease revenue. Manitoba’s competitiveness in producing and processing protein will be reduced while lowering our province’s capacity to export the agricultural commodities that other countries rely upon to process food.

      <description>Global Poultry Culling Doubles to 94.2 million kills as Food Shortage Crisis Deepens

The number of poultry culled around the world has almost doubled this season as global food shortages loom and the cost of living crisis deepens.

Experts are warning that an “unprecedented” bird flu outbreak has caused a huge spike in culling since last season.

According to figures from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), more than 22 million cases have been reported in wild birds and poultry so far this season in 68 countries.

This figure is double the 11m recorded between October 2020 and September 2021, itself an all-time high.

In an effort to curb the outbreak, 94.2m farmed poultry have been killed and disposed of.

Last season, 54.4m were culled.

      <description>Finland: grocery stores may close to conserve power

Grocery stores in Finland could have to take turns closing for hours at a time to reduce their energy usage this winter, the country’s grid operator told news outlet YLE on Sunday. With fuel shortages expected, Finnish households will also be told to lower their consumption.

According to the grid operator, Finland’s roughly 2,800 food stores will need to come to arrangements with each other over who will close and who will stay open if power is rationed in a particular area. This kind of agreement is especially important in rural areas to ensure that all the outlets in one town or village don’t end up shutting at the same time, YLE noted.

      <description>WELL PUT: decarbonization strangling food production:

&gt;&gt; “A close friend farms over 10,000 acres of corn in the mid-west. The property is spread out over 3 counties. His operation is a "partnership farm" with John Deere. They use the larger farm operations as demonstration projects for promotion and development of new equipment. He recently received a phone call from his John Deere representative, and they want the farm to go to electric tractors and combines in 2023. He currently has 5 diesel combines that cost $900,000 each that are traded in every 3 years. Also, over 10 really BIG tractors. JD wants him to go all electric soon.

He said: "Ok, I have some questions.

- How do I charge these combines when they are 3 counties away from the shop in the middle of a cornfield, in the middle of nowhere?

- How do I run them 24 hours a day for 10 or 12 days straight when the harvest is ready, and the weather is coming in?

- How do I get a 50,000+ lb. combine that takes up the width of an entire road back to the shop 20 miles away when the battery goes dead?

There was dead silence on the other end of the phone.

When the corn is ready to harvest, it has to have the proper sugar and moisture content. If it is too wet, it has to be put in giant dryers that burn natural or propane gas, and lots of it. Harvest time is critical because if it degrades in sugar content or quality, it can drop the value of his crop by half a million dollars or more. It is analyzed at time of sale. It is standard procedure to run these machines 10 to 12 days straight, 24 hours a day at peak harvest time. When they need fuel, a tanker truck delivers it, and the machines keep going. John Deere's only answer is "we're working on it." They are being pushed by the Zero carbon agenda to force these electric machines on the American farmer.

These people are out of control. They are messing with the production of food crops that feed people and livestock... all in the name of their "green dream."
Look for the cost of your box of cornflakes to triple in the next 24 months...”

Wake up! Stand up! Speak up!
Let's return sanity to our nation.</description>

      <description>OPEN SOURCE INTEL: I’d posted to @iceagefarmer that I’d received many reports of poor germination and other issues from corporate seed sources, and asked people to share what they were seeing.

Over 700 people replied. Here is a summary; huge thanks to Kate B. for reviewing  compiling, and sharing.  It paints an interesting gestalt of a uniquely difficult season.  Original thread here.  (How's your garden doing?)

[ Join the garden group: @iaf_garden !  More groups: @iaf_groups ]

Just been through about 700+ comments from the US, Canada, Europe, UK, Sweden, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and beyond:

a) seeds are showing poor germination from a wide range of suppliers
b) those that do germinate and start to grow are doing so i) slower than usual  OR ii) are getting so far in their growth then dying (a bit like Tesco's herbs unless you transplant into fresh earth!) OR iii) are growing well but producing greenery not edible produce, so poor yields
c) suspicion is also falling on contaminated bagged compost -- many reports of issues here, some discussion around Grazon contamination
d) in addition, folks are noticing that store bought veg &amp; fruit is not lasting, plus some is rotten on opening although firm externally
e) suggestions also being made about soil alkalinity from chemtrails inhibiting growth
f) some people raising animals are getting all male babies [!?]
g) sunflowers &amp; other plants are being burnt up by the sun's rays
h) there is poor growth/yield from fruit trees
j) plentiful complaints from folks that have been growing for 25-40 years that things just aren't right with a degree of confusion as to the source
k) livestock feed prices are skyrocketing
l) many sick &amp; dead animals around this year &amp; dead birds found daily (Italy)
m)  too hot/ too dry/ no rain/ storms/ erratic weather with false forecasting
n)  absence of bees for pollination
p) cold nights inhibiting growth
q) abundance of pests &amp; bugs at levels not seen before
r)  zucchini with zero female flowers
s) blatant chemtrail spraying with some warning of "cancer in the ground for gardeners",
t) healthy hens stopping laying
u) pullets dropping dead at 6 months with no obvious cause
v) cooler spring so plants are a month behind
w) hard to get the cows/goats back in calf
x)  change in taste of store bought veg/fruit
y) salads are going straight to seed and bolting
z) overall poor germination &amp; growth - a weird growing year,

      <description>Beirut's 2020-Blast-Hit Grain-Silos Suddenly Collapse In Massive Plume Of Debris

Beirut's grain silos - that were massively damaged in 2020 - have suddenly collapsed this morning, sparking a huge cloud of smoke and debris.

[as more of our food supply chain spontaneously combusts…]

Everyone remembers the shocking images from August 5th 2020 as a massive blast, caused by an estimated 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse at the port unsecured for years, killed over 200 individuals and injured more than 6000.

      <description>California announces plan to charge landowners for their own water

It's not satire — it's Agenda 2030 perfect awareness of all resources and economic activity.

California has announced to landowners that they now are going to be billed for the water they take out of their own wells, on their own land.  Hundreds of dollars in fees are looming, with 25% penalties for those who don't pay on time:

"Landowners whose property is within an unmanaged area and contains an operating ground water extraction well must report the volume of groundwater extracted from the well. The groundwater extraction volume must be reported as a monthly total. In addition to pumping volumes, reports must include the location of the well and the place and purpose of use of the groundwater. Groundwater extraction reports are not due to the state water board until February 1, 2023. However, if you are required to report, the report must include pumping volumes for each month between the date of receipt of this letter and September 30, 2022."

      <description>Beef prices set to surge further as farmers sell off/liquidate cattle herds

tl;dr: Beef prices are only just beginning to rise.

_____

U.S. cattle producers are sending higher numbers of breeding stock to the sale barn, and some are liquidating their herds entirely, signaling a trend that analysts say will likely push already-elevated beef prices even higher in the not-too-distant future.
The latest cattle report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows the market has contracted to levels not seen in years, with total inventory dropping 2% to 98.8 million head since July 2021.

UN, World Economic Forum Behind Global ‘War on Farmers’: Experts

‘Agenda 2030' development goals at root of sustainability policies that could lead to food shortages

The escalating regulatory attack on agricultural producers from Holland and the United States to Sri Lanka and beyond is closely tied to UN Agenda 2030” Sustainable Development Goals and the U.N.’s partners at the World Economic Forum (WEF), numerous experts told The Epoch Times.
Indeed, several of the U.N.’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are directly implicated in policies that are squeezing farmers, ranchers, and food supplies around the world.

The narrative is so bizarre. “But grandpa why did she want so badly to go to Taiwan?!” “No one really knows.”

      <description>!!! — BASF's massive German plant will be reducing production at facilities requiring natural gas.  As I warned in March, the plants provide both fertilizers and vitamins used in production of animal feed, and this is another blow to farmers.

BASF CEO warned farmers would face soaring fertiliser costs next year.

Ammonia production has been reduced considerably in German already because of high gas prices, said chemical industry lobby VCI.

IAF: And just today the EU intends to ration gas 15% across board — this is a full crash, not a soft landing.

You wondered how they would achieve the #AbsoluteZero elimination of fossil fuels by 2030?  You are watching it.

Exclusive: Thousands of U.S. cattle buried, dumped at Kansas landfill

Top U.S. cattle feeding companies sent 1,000-pound carcasses to a Kansas landfill, where they were flattened by loader machines and mixed with trash, after a June heatwave killed thousands of cows, documents seen by Reuters show.

Other cattle were buried in unlined graves, a feeding company said.

Neither is a typical method for disposing of bodies. But so many cows died in the unusual heat and humidity that facilities that normally convert carcasses into pet food and fertilizer products were overwhelmed, prompting the state government and cattle feeders to take emergency measures.

      <description>Rail delays / problems are mounting (even though the strike was delayed) — it is a problem for this grain to not be moving.  Contributing to animal feed shortages and the degradation of the entire food supply chain:
__
Rail service delays in the past three months climbed a staggering 231% compared to a year ago, according to a new American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) analysis.
There were 204,000 unfilled grain car orders in the second quarter of 2022, compared to 62,000 last year, AFBF economist Daniel Munch said.

“Conditions have not im­proved for shippers since our first quarter analysis,” said Munch, noting that the number of unfilled orders climbed 49% since the first...

      <description>tl;dr: European Commission predicts yield of wheat/barley/corn will be down 2.5% YoY due to drought, "experts" rush to blame climate change:

__
Europe is staring into one of its driest summers in living memory.

The drought has already crimped production of hydroelectric power and food, adding to market pressure from the war in Ukraine. Many city authorities have asked residents to cut back their use of drinking water.

With global food flows already squeezed, the drought has Europe’s farmers spooked. [IAF: perhaps not the word I would use for it.] Hungary's agriculture ministry said Wednesday that as of the beginning of the month it had received 8,413 drought damage notifications covering 322,000 hectares in 2022, three times the area of any previous first half of the year.

It should be a fun chance to reach a few million radio listeners, drop some solid red pills, but also offer hope!  Not sure if Ian will take calls this time, but see you there!

      <description>PANAMA CITY (AP) — Three weeks of continuous demonstrations and road blockades to protest high fuel and food costs in Panama have begun to cause shortages of some food products, fuel and medicine.

The closures, including of the Pan-American Highway, have forced the national electric company to ration electricity in Darien province, which borders Colombia. Tankers carrying gas to run the power generation plant cannot arrive. Some 7,000 families have been affected by the reduction of electricity to 11 hours daily.

In Panama’s main wholesale market that supplies both supermarkets and individual consumers, there was little foot traffic Wednesday. Display tables usually stacked high with produce had far less on offer. Some vegetables like lettuce and tomatos, in particular, were in short supply.

      <description>It may seem as though all is in disarray and things are simply spiraling out of control.  But I must caution you that underneath that techno-fog of war, a machine continues to operate with great precision and efficiency.

That machine actively works to take land from farmers to construct massive “carbon pipelines” to carry CO2 and inject it deep into the earth to “store it safely out of the atmosphere.”

The machine is taking prime farmland to construct massive solar farms — in the heart of our corn belt in Indiana, Iowa , and Illinois just to pick three examples:

“This will be the last year that Norm Welker and his family harvests corn. But Welker will still be a farmer — he’s going to farm the sun.

“Welker is not alone: He is one of dozens of neighbors who are leasing their land for what will be the largest solar farm in the United States. At 13,000 acres [of prime crop land] it is aptly named the Mammoth Solar project and is a partnership between state of Indiana &amp; Israeli-based Doral Renewables LLC!!!!

These are just a few waves visible across a vast ocean of green agenda shutdowns, regulations, and takeover of farming and ranching.

&gt;&gt; Grow food. Raise animals. Support local farmers — cultivate local food systems! &lt;&lt;

      <description>They are winning the war on meat — protein pipeline shrinking. Are you growing/raising your own?

&gt; USDA’s Cattle Inventory Report is expected to show U.S. cattle herd as of July 1 down 2.1% from year-ago.

The projected 2022 calf crop is expected to have shrunk another 2%.
Beef heifers held back for breeding are expected to be down 3.2% from last year.

      <description>Russia Sends Combine Harvesters to Occupied Regions of Ukraine

Russia has sent combine harvesters from Crimea to two Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine to cover a shortage of equipment needed to bring in the crop, a representative of a Russian-installed local administration said.

The official said the harvesters were needed because "the equipment that was there before had either been dismantled or taken away by the previous owners outside the regions", he said. [IAF: By those who are consistently working to destroy global food production]

Evgeny Balitsky, head of the occupation administration in Zaporizhzhia, said on social media that these combine harvesters were provided by Russia's agriculture ministry.

      <description>Colder temps in Russia cause protein content in wheat to drop - even though the harvest is large, the prices of high-quality wheat are still rising:

__
Poor weather over parts of Russia's main producing regions is likely to mean that the supply of higher protein wheat will remain in relatively tight supply - supporting an increased price gap between quality milling wheats and lower quality grades, trade sources have told Agricensus.

Russia is on course to deliver its biggest ever wheat crop, but higher yields and rains over some of the main Russian producing regions mean the crop currently being harvested is showing more 11.5% or feed grades were harvested so far compared to last year.

The price gap between the 12.5%, 11.5%, and feed wheat grades have been increasing over the last week with a gap of almost $16-17/mt seen between 11.5% and 12.5% grades in coaster-sized CIF Marmara trades last week, but offers on a deep sea port basis have also widened to show the same $17/mt differential.

      <description>Macron announces "Turn off your lights" as it becomes clear Russia will not continue providing gas:

"French President Emmanuel Macron warned his country’s people Thursday to prepare for a total cutoff of Russian natural gas by supporting alternatives, having public lights switched off at night and engaging in a period of nationwide energy “sobriety.”

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and ensuing sanctions have aggravated other factors driving up prices for energy and others goods. With no end in sight for the Ukraine war, Macron said, the French should brace themselves for costs to remain high.

“This war will continue,” he said in a televised interview marking France’s national holiday, Bastille Day. “The summer, early autumn will be very hard.”"

      <description>Italy's PM Draghi resigns. So:

- Italy's Draghi is out
- UK's Boris Johnson is out
- Abe is eliminated in Japan
- Estonia's PM has resigned
- Irish government - no confidence vote
- Dutch protests continue to gain steam — German farmers are joining

Amazing how quickly things are moving.  Expect more as the West continues to be destroyed from within ... (as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt move towards BRICS!)

In other words, Andrey should already be worried about corn.

And about the culling of cattle herds happening now in Texas drought.

Grow your garden folks. Things are getting rough, and accelerating quickly.

      <description>Italian onion harvest starts with lower yield due to drought

The onion harvest in the southern Italian province of Bari is underway and it appears that yields are already declining. "We are now in the middle of the harvest and we are trying to move up a gear to get ahead of any weather change. We needed rain in April and May, not now," said Vito Abrusci, director of the growers' association La Vera Cipolla Rossa di Acquaviva delle Fonti.

One can search directly for articles and see my site is filtered out — and obviously I am not the only one.

      <description>“What happens after they burn down the farms?"

ANSWER:

EU’s Plan to Replace Farms – CITIES2030 – Digital Twin of Food Supply (nov 2021)

As our food supply is systematically dismantled, the EU is funding a project to create “Urban Food Systems” and a blockchain-based “digital twin” platform to track indoor farming and synthetic meat from laboratory to plate to sewers. Is this an organic response to a crisis, or a nefarious plan, generations in the making, being realized before our eyes? Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

      <description>Ghana:  food shortages hit schools as students drink porridge without bread and sugar

There appears to be a serious food shortage in Senior High Schools in the country. This is a result of the poor food supply situation in the schools which is reported to have reached dire and deteriorated levels.

He said the students are given porridge without milk, sugar, and bread adding that "Dear parents, these are our boys, and as a parents association, we have less than GH¢1,000 in our coffers. What can this do?"

The Headmaster of St Augustine's, Henry Arthur-Gyan, also said the school had no option but to manage the situation.  "We know there are challenges and so we manage with what we are provided. There is not much we can do about it," he stated.

[ @iceagefarmer note:  expect media to play up school food shortages as a key concept in the Rockefeller ‘Reset the Table’ agenda is to use schools as “nutritional hubs” for communities ]

      <description>Canada plans a nitrogen policy like the one fueling farmer protests in Netherlands:

This is the destruction of farming and ranching as a hostile takeover of human food production.

“The Government of Canada has set the national fertilizer emissions reduction target of 30%, which is part of the commitment to reduce total GHG emissions in Canada by 40-45% by 2030…”

      <description>Cattle producers struggling with high cost of feed

“Most beef producers in this area have their cattle out on grass now, so they don’t have to buy hay or grain. But it’s going to be a problem in the fall; it’s difficult to make a profit in this business when you have to pay $8 or $9 for a bushel of grain to help these cattle through the cold winters,” Balicki said. “And, you do have to give cattle grain in this part of the world, because they need the energy to keep warm. So that’s a huge concern.”

      <description>UK dairy farmers warn of price rises amid chronic staff shortages

Dairy farmers are warning that a chronic shortage of workers is hitting milk production and further fuelling food price inflation, and are calling for urgent action to stop the situation getting worse.

Eight in 10 farm owners looking for workers said they had received very few or zero applications from people with the right experience or qualifications, in response to a survey by Arla Foods, the UK’s largest dairy co-operative.

      <description>European energy crisis has boiled over — things on the continent are about to change, rapidly and more absolutely than most can imagine:

- Germany: is restricting when and how energy companies can declare force majeure;

- France: has just nationalized the nation’s largest energy company, EDF;

- UK: announced they, too, would simply cut off natgas to the EU when supply is short;

- The EU has decided that nuclear and natural gas energy are “green” after all, a semantic change which only marginally lengthens the runway for their ‘decarbonization transition’

These are major moves that signal the hard landing ahead — brace for impact, my friends.

      <description>AWFUL:  animal feed shortages reported in the USA as deliveries remain scarce:

”The point has been reached when millions of chickens will be killed and other livestock will suffer because of UP’s [IAF: that is WEF partner Union Pacific] service failures,” Foster Farms wrote in its request to the Surface Transportation Board this week.

Rail bottlenecks in the U.S. are not improving, and in some cases, growing more severe. Feed users in California and the Southwest are having issues sourcing grain, with some reporting they are paying $3 over the CBOT price to secure grain by truck. Not only are feed users on the brink of running out of grain, but there are also concerns the rail issues could grow worse during harvest this fall.

[ plenty of ideas on how to grow your own animal feed in @iaf_birds ! ]

      <description>EXPERTS WARN: MASK UP IN THE GARDEN!

This explosion of cardiac issues? It’s because people started gardening during the pandemic.

Gardening is DIRTY and DANGEROUS and can KILL YOU — you should ONLY eat fake meat and bugs.  NEVER GARDEN.  You will be SAFE inside away from DIRTY animals and DANGEROUS soil.

[These people will stop at nothing to control your food supply!]

__

Urgent warning to gardeners as soil ‘increases risk of killer heart disease’

Medics found that pollutants in the soil could have a 'detrimental effect on the cardiovascular system'.  “Contaminated soil could lead to increasing oxidative stress in the blood vessels, which in turn leads to heart disease.”

Dirty soil can get into the blood stream, through inhalation.

      <description>Unscheduled power outages result in high chicken mortalities - some farmers give up as Incubators run cold, freezers full of product thaw out, and losses mount.

__
Power grid “Load shedding” drops certain zones deemed non-critical — but this is causing farmers to lose their animals!

Deidre Carter, CEO of Agri Limpopo, said one of the organisation’s members had reported losing about 2 000 broiler chickens in a single day due to Eskom’s unilateral load-reduction strategy, while another had decided to leave the poultry industry altogether.

“Load reduction is a lot worse than [rolling blackouts], because one never knows when or how long the power will be out,” she told Farmer’s Weekly.

      <description>"Hot water at night is a luxury that you can no longer afford"

The zero-carbon agenda is cold and miserable.

A housing cooperative near Dresden had announced that it would only provide hot water at certain times. The reason: the high gas prices. Federal Building Minister Geywitz criticized that this was "illegal".The announcement by a Saxon housing cooperative to restrict the hot water supply has met with massive criticism in politics. Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) told the newspapers of the Funke media group: "Simply turning off the hot water temporarily is illegal."

Supermarkets appear to be toughening its security measures on foodstuffs as shoppers feel the financial pinch of soaring inflation

Supermarkets have been spotted adding security tags to basic food items like cheese, as the cost of living crisis sees pricing spiralling.

Britons took to social media to share pictures of tags more commonly used on bottles of alcohol attached to £3.99 blocks of Aldi cheddar.

... Farmers are protesting new policies which "will lead to at least 30% of Dutch farms being put out of business as they’re forced to cut the number of livestock by the same figure."

Anger has intensified after the government revealed the same nitrogen cuts, being proposed in the name of fighting climate change, won’t be applied to the airline industry.

      <description>CO2 shortage threatens New Zealand chicken supplies

Plans are in progress to reduce production of some chicken products, according to the country’s leading poultry meat producer.

Tegel is warning that it may not be able to produce some chicken products because of a shortage of carbon dioxide gas in New Zealand that is also threatening brewers and fizzy drinks makers.

The Food and Grocery Council said the availability of cheese, preserved meats, sparkling wine and ready-to-eat meals could also suffer, with price rises possible.

The Brewers Association and the Beverage Council separately voiced concerns about the gas shortage on Saturday.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is used widely in the food industry – including in packaging to preserve the shelf life of chicken – and to add fizz to drinks, as well as in other industries such as healthcare.

Businesses used to get much of their CO2 supply from the Marsden Point oil refinery, which produced CO2 as a by-product of its refining operation until that was replaced in favor of importing energy.

      <description>Libya declares force majeure on oil exports after weeks of protests and port blockades.

This is major news on its own, but also needs to be considered from Europe's perspective:

- 6% of EU oil &amp; gas imports are from Libya and were just taken off the table.
- 34% of EU oil and 55% of gas comes from Russia, which is being throttled
- Freeport terminal in TX was blown up and cannot send LNG
- UK just announced they'd stop gas exports to EU if there were shortages
- EU and UK are both frantically burning gas just to generate electricity now, instead of storing for the winter ahead!

- Greenhouses, food plants and facilities are ALREADY SHUT DOWN due to the cost of energy — and somehow things keep blowing up!  This is an absolute CONTROLLED DEMOLITION.

Europe is being strangled !!
