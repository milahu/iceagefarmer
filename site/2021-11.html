              Namibia suspended imports of live poultry, birds, and poultry products from Germany and the Netherlands on Monday after outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu in the European countries.
<br />
<br />Germany reported the bird flu outbreak at a goose farm last week while commercial farms across the Netherlands were ordered to keep all poultry inside after an outbreak at a farm in the central province of Flevoland.
<br />
<br />It said consignments of poultry products packed from October 1 in Germany and October 5 in the Netherlands would be rejected and returned or destroyed at a cost to the importer.

              AP reporting that Tyson’s vax mandate led to 96% of workers to get vaccine.
<br />
<br />Today (11/1) was their deadline.  And that is 120,000 workers.
<br />
<br />“To those who remain unvaccinated,” said Tyson CEO, “your choice, we respect that choice.  If you change your mind and want to rejoin Tyson — let us know. Our doors are open.”

              Has anyone been able to confirm the seizure of bank accounts in Victoria, Australia for “being unvaccinated?”  I’m see the report echoed everywhere (with that one mini SMS clip from Max Igan) but not able to get hard data.
<br />
<br />It is worth investigating as not only is it horrific, but could prompt runs on banks in Aus and around the world in anticipation of similar measures…

<br />Chicago wheat futures rose to their highest level in 8-1/2 years on Monday, buoyed by strong demand against the backdrop of tightening world supplies, while corn prices edged higher.
<br />
<br />Dealers noted a massive wheat purchase by Saudi Arabia, while top importer Egypt was also in the market on Monday.
<br />
<br />… Poor spring wheat harvests and an export duty imposed by Russia have heightened expectations of relatively tight supplies this season.
<br />
<br />Prices in Europe also rose with March milling wheat on Euronext up by 1.6% at a 13-1/2-year peak of 283.50 euros a tonne.

              To feed lab-grown single cell protein to animals is to defile the web of life — and sets the stage to feed these synthetic foods to humanity:

<br />CHINA TO MAKE PROTEIN FOR LIVESTOCK FROM CARBON MONOXIDE
<br />
<br />Chinese researchers say they have found a way to produce an animal feed protein from carbon monoxide in what is being hailed as a breakthrough that could help reduce the country&#39;s reliance on huge volumes of imported soybeans.
<br />
<br />China is by far the world&#39;s top buyer of soybeans, bringing in around 100 million tonnes a year to turn into protein-rich feed for its huge livestock sector.
<br />
<br />A portion of those beans could one day by replaced by synthetically made protein, however.
<br />
<br />The Feed Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) says it has worked with Beijing Shoulang Biological Technology to speed up a gas fermentation process to create a single cell protein that could be fed to animals, according to a report on Sunday on a website run by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

              I read this short story the other day and it has stuck with me:  most people still depend on the system to feed them.  The system is being destroyed.  Many people react, “Good, down with the system!” without understanding they have no way to survive.  I know this audience is actively working on taking control of their own food security, but still a spooky read:

<br />The Machine Stops
<br />
<br />Written in 1909, E. M. Forster&#39;s &#34;The Machine Stops&#34; is a tragically prophetic meditation upon the consequences of man&#39;s over reliance upon technology.
<br />
<br />It describes a world in which humans have lost the ability to live on the surface of the Earth. Each individual lives in isolation in a &#39;cell&#39;, with all bodily and spiritual needs met by the omnipotent, global Machine.

              WEF’s “Invest in Forests” Exposed: Global Surveillance Grid
<br />
<br />(Here is my full report mentioned in above post)
<br />
<br />The World Economic Forum’s “Investing in Forests” program sounds great – who doesn’t want to plant more trees? But behind its philanthropic appeal lies a global surveillance grid, monitoring all activity on the planet — just as prescribed by Agenda 2030 and their 4th Industrial Revolution. Christian shares an unreleased document and reveals the truth in this special Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

              BoJo plots move from meat-based diets for &#39;bio-engineered burgers&#39; ahead of COP26
<br />
<br />Boris thinks humanity could soon abandon eating meat in favour of lab-grown, eco-friendly alternatives in a drastic bid to save the planet.
<br />
<br />Mr Johnson said: &#34;I think in the future - I&#39;ve got to be honest - I think in the future, we will move away from eating as much meat.
<br />
<br />&#34;I think that already science is developing meat substitutes that are basically engineered in a lab, that are very like meat and you won&#39;t be able to tell the difference between a bio-engineered hamburger and - I&#39;m serious - and a real hamburger.
<br />
<br />&#34;And that will be the future very soon. I mean it&#39;s already here, I think.&#34;
<br />
<br />Ms Steele added: &#34;It is, definitely, and I think there&#39;s also things we can do to mix up our meals.
<br />
<br />&#34;Maybe less meat and put some beans in. It can still be very tasty but great for our climate.&#34;

<br />China Sparks &#34;Panic Buying&#34; After Telling Households To Stockpile Food Ahead Of Winter
<br />
<br />Ministry of Commerce told households Monday to stock up on food in case of emergencies after a resurgence of the virus pandemic, heavy rains that sparked vegetable prices to jump, and the onset of colder weather. 
<br />
<br />The commerce ministry directive is similar to the one released ahead of the holidays at the start of October, which told local governments to secure food supplies. The order comes as a coronavirus outbreak prompted fresh lockdowns. 
<br />
<br />The directive was released on the government&#39;s Weibo account, a similar platform to Twitter, stated: &#34;Ministry of Commerce encourages households to stockpile daily necessities as needed.&#34; It had more than 17 million views as of Tuesday. Some netizens were concerned that an impending invasion of Taiwan was the reason for the stockpiling directive. 
<br />
<br />&#34;As soon as this news came out, all the old people near me went crazy panic buying in the supermarket,&#34; wrote one Weibo user.

<br />It’s not a protest at this point, because the “leaders” aren’t listening...indeed they are the ones perpetrating this war on the people, on humanity.  It is a prayer.

              Farmers Panic, Can&#39;t Get Supplies to Grow Food
<br />
<br />Around the world, farmers are panicking as they are unable to get the supplies they need to produce food, from fertilizers to herbicides to tractor parts. India has setup a &#34;War Room&#34; for fertilizers after China stopped exports of DAP, prompting farmers to riot to obtain the product they need. Many nations are now limiting exports of food and these inputs, so that they may feed their own people. This was all foreseen by the Food Chain Reaction Game, which--like Event 201--announced this engineered crisis, and pre-scripted the solution. Christian breaks it down in this important Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

              Russia just joined China in STOPPING their exports of fertilizer.  
<br />
<br />This news underscores my report from yesterday, Farmers Panic, Can’t Get Supplies to Grow Food — meaning things are going from bad to worse:
<br />
<br />____
<br />Russia plans to impose a six-month quota on some fertilizer exports to safeguard local supplies and limit costs for farmers after the energy crisis sent nitrogen nutrient prices soaring.
<br />
<br />The move -- covering exports of nitrogen and complex fertilizers containing nitrogen -- comes as nutrients prices have surged globally as soaring gas prices boost production costs and force some plants to cut production. That risks curbing harvests in the year ahead and accelerating food inflation.
<br />
<br />European farmers have already voiced concern about securing fertilizer supplies for the spring, when they’re applied to grain fields to boost yields and quality. French farm groups said last month nitrogen prices have tripled and there’s a risk of shortages to come. China has also curbed exports to ensure enough domestic supply.
<br />
<br />“A Russian export quota will tighten further global markets already scrambling for supply,” said Alexis Maxwell, an analyst at Green Markets, a business owned by Bloomberg. “Russia’s close proximity to the U.S. has meant it is a growing nitrogen supplier to the U.S.”

              Alberta, Canada - durum wheat increased by 70% over a year:
<br />
<br />The price of pasta is expected to rise at the grocery store and on restaurant menus because of a summer drought that affected durum wheat crops in Alberta and elsewhere.
<br />
<br />In August the price of Alberta durum wheat hit nearly $500 per tonne. That&#39;s 70 per cent higher than it was in August of 2020.
<br />
<br />&#34;If you got $12 to $14 [per] bushel once in a while, in the past you were doing exceptionally [well], but when it got up to over $20 [per] bushel, I mean, that&#39;s basically been unheard of in our industry up until now,&#34; said Lynn Jacobson, president of the Alberta Federation of Agriculture.

              Yara CEO issues warning, without fertilizer food will run short - a “life or death” crisis:
<br />
<br />“I want to say this loud and clear right now, that we risk a very low crop in the next harvest,&#34; said Svein Tore Holsether, the CEO and president of the Oslo-based company. &#34;I’m afraid we’re going to have a food crisis.”
<br />
<br />The delayed effects of the energy crisis on food security could mimic the chip shortage crisis, Holsether said.
<br />
<br />&#34;That&#39;s all linked to factories being shut down in March, April, and May of last year, and we&#39;re reaping the consequences of that now,&#34; he said. &#34;But if we get the equivalent to the food system…not having food is not annoying, that&#39;s a matter of life or death.&#34;

              Warning over ‘extremely low’ wine production in Europe due to bad weather
<br />
<br />Industry body head warns there is ‘no vaccine’ against climate change and winemakers must adapt with ‘urgent necessity’
<br />
<br />[ Yes, that’s really the sub headline …  And good morning to everyone except COP26 ]
<br />
<br />World wine production is expected to fall to one of its lowest levels on record after harsh weather battered vineyards in Europe’s major wine-producing regions.
<br />
<br />The conditions “severely impacted” production in Italy, Spain and France, resulting in “extremely low” production volumes, an international wine body has said.
<br />
<br />This would mark a third consecutive year of below-average output and approach the 2017 level of 248 mhl, the smallest in six decades, according to the OIV. One hectolitre is the equivalent of 133 standard bottles.

              Nitrogen Shortage to Force U.S. Farmers to Scale Back Fertilizer, CF Says
<br />
<br /> A shortage of nitrogen fertilizer is getting so bad that farmers won’t be able to get what they need for their fields in the near future.
<br />
<br />If the owner of the world’s largest nitrogen facility is right and farmers have to scale back fertilizer applications, that could lower corn yields, pushing up the price of food even further. Food inflation is already a concern, with a United Nations gauge of global prices at a decade high.
<br />
<br />Fertilizer is scarce right now because high costs for natural gas, a key raw material, have halted some production in Europe. Other countries like China and Russia are imposing restrictions on exports to try and safeguard local supplies.
<br />
<br />The U.S. is a major importer of farm nutrients, importing 20% of its urea and 40% of ammonium nitrate from Russia alone.

              Chinese supermarkets are rationing CABBAGE — 3 per customer — and STILL RUN OUT! in response  in response to the flood of people trying to stock up after the CCP issued a warning of food shortages:
<br />____
<br />
<br />Older residents in Beijing recently stocked up on cabbage, giving a tradition a new lease of life after the government advised people to keep enough basic goods at home in case of emergencies.
<br />
<br />People have for years bought dozens of large cabbages, which can be kept fresh for months and are widely used in local cuisine, in early November to see them through freezing winters.
<br />
<br />A government notice issued last Monday advising households to stock up on daily necessities and a snow forecast reinforced the rush this year, with long early morning queues forming outside supermarkets in downtown Beijing last week.
<br />
<br />Supermarkets capped sales at three cabbages per person, but even then, shoppers arriving after 9am left empty-handed.

              More farms spontaneously combusting.  The trend has accelerated greatly since last year, when I started reporting on it:
<br />____
<br />
<br />“Hay bale and barn fires on farms in East Sussex were started deliberately, police have said.  The fires at Beddingham, Alfriston, Tarring Neville and Litlington happened between 2 and 7 November.  Police are working with the fire service to find who is responsible and have increased patrols in the area.
<br />
<br />Sgt Jon Attfield from the Sussex Police rural crime team described the attacks as &#34;disturbing&#34;.
<br />
<br />&#34;This is a highly destructive crime that impacts our farming community and livestock supplies,&#34; he said.”

              32,500 trees destroyed.  Many farms bulldozed across California.  Midwest farmland confiscated for destruction for carbon pipelines [post above].  We are being killed…
<br />_____
<br />
<br />To fight off a California dust bowl, the state will pay farmers to reimagine idle land
<br />
<br /> Farmer Erik Herman said he couldn’t help but feel a tinge of remorse as he looked out over the dirt field where an orchard of 8,000 fig trees stood until earlier this month, when they were uprooted by bulldozers in the name of conservation. 
<br />
<br />The orchard, seven miles outside Madera in the sprawling San Joaquin Valley, is another casualty of the water shortage that is forcing farmers in the nation’s top-producing agricultural region to abandon otherwise fertile ground en masse.
<br />
<br />Tractors barreled past on a recent morning, kicking up clouds of dust as they yanked out tree roots still hidden under the soil. Herman walked through the once-thriving orchard, nodding to heaps of dead tree trunks stacked densely in the center of the field.
<br />
<br />Erik’s father who runs their specialty crop business, said he has no idea what to do next with the 300 acres, the equivalent of about 32,500 tress, they plan to raze this fall.
<br />
<br />“It’s just going to sit there. It will probably never be farmed again,” he said. “We will be a good neighbor and keep the weeds down. To the extent that we can, we’ll keep the dust down, but that’s a tough one.”

              Analysts expect more soybeans, less corn, due to fertilizer shortages…
<br />__
<br />
<br />High cost, short supply of fertilizer to alter 2022 planting
<br />
<br />Farmers in the United States are likely to plant less corn and use less nitrogen fertilizer on their fields for next year’s growing season due to sky-high fertilizer prices and short supplies. That trend will be less pronounced in Iowa, where fertile soils make the extra costs worthwhile.
<br />
<br />A confluence of factors has led agricultural fertilizers to reach their highest prices in two decades, according to Green Markets, which tracks those price trends.
<br />
<br />“You’ve got a lot of different factors that are coming to bear at a certain moment in time,” Funk said.
<br />
<br />He said farmers are paying up to three times the price for fertilizer they paid a year ago, and some say it’s worse:
<br />
<br />“Some of our farmers who have been able to guarantee fertilizer availability for next planting season have reported being quoted prices up to six times as high as 2021 prices,” U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, a northwest Iowa Republican, said during a congressional hearing last week.
<br />
<br />One alternative is soybeans, which make their own nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with certain bacteria. Bradyrhizobium japonicum can infect soybean roots, and in exchange for the plants’ sugars, the bacteria fix nitrogen.
<br />
<br />#fertilizer #usa 
<br />
<br />“Will Iowa producers switch more over to soybeans?” Funk said. “Some, but not probably to a great extent in this state. You have a yield factor that would penalize you for planting soybeans after soybeans.”

              Rolls-Royce To Develop Mini Nuke Reactors To Decarbonize Power Grid 
<br />
<br />In a world where ESG is all the rage, and the transition from coal to cleaner energy sources is paramount, the UK has become the latest country to embrace nuclear power. 
<br />
<br />According to a company press release, Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc raised $617 million to fund &#34;the next generation of low cost, low carbon nuclear power technology.&#34;
<br />
<br />Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources UK Limited, and Exelon Generation Limited will develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) that will allow the country to meet net-zero commitments. SMRs will be built in the UK and open for export to customers worldwide. 
<br />
<br />With every passing week, our core thesis set here last December (see &#34;Uranium Stocks Soar: Is This The Beginning Of The Next ESG Craze&#34;) is that nuclear would be widely embraced as a net-zero enabling technology for power grids.
<br />
<br />Warren East, the Rolls-Royce CEO, adds, &#34;the SMR program is one of the ways that Rolls-Royce is meeting the need to ensure the UK continues to develop innovative ways to tackle the global threat of climate change.
<br />
<br />&#34;With the Rolls-Royce SMR technology, we have developed a clean energy solution which can deliver cost-competitive and scalable net-zero power for multiple applications from grid and industrial electricity production to hydrogen and synthetic fuel manufacturing,&#34; East said. 
<br />
<br />SMRs are a much cheaper solution than big nuclear power plants that have been in use for more than half a century. Nuclear power will be at the heart of Britain&#39;s strategy to reach net-zero carbon emissions in the coming decades, along with the rest of the world. 
<br />
<br />A combination of nuclear power via SMRs, renewables, carbon capture, and storage could be part of a balanced net-zero grid.

              Relief from High Prices Unlikely, Analysts Say Ahead of Consumer Inflation Data Release
<br />
<br />“Inflation is broadening out, with the necessities of food and shelter together accounting for more than half of the increase in September. Consumers are feeling it in the pocketbook at the grocery store and tenants in many parts of the country could get sticker shock at their next lease renewal,” McBride said.
<br />
<br />Wells Fargo analysts say it’s unlikely sticker-shock-weary consumers will see relief as the persistent supply-side crunch will “keep fanning the flames on inflation in the near term.”

              PepsiCo has been experimenting with alternative sources of protein for years now — including from crickets to mealworms -- almost as if the WEF strategic partner was aware the food supply was to “fundamentally transform” in the years to come:
<br />
<br />[2017] PepsiCo — the food company that makes snacks like Doritos, Cheetos, and Quaker Oats cereal — is looking for alternative protein sources for its products. 
<br />
<br />These non-traditional proteins could include plant-based protein, mycoprotein (a protein made from mushrooms), or insect protein.
<br />
<br />The request also mentioned that PepsiCo has already done extensive work with soy, moringa (a protein powder made from dried leaves), duckweed, cricket powder, pea protein, dairy, single cell protein, and mealworm powder (generally made from roasted and milled mealworms).

<br />Russia deploys icebreakers as cold snap catches ships out along the Northern Sea Route
<br />
<br />An earlier covering of sea ice in Arctic waters this year compared to many previous years has caught a number of ships out with icebreakers called out to help vessels which have become stuck in the East Siberian Sea.
<br />
<br />Local authorities report there are some 20 ships that are either are stuck or struggling to make it across the icy waters of the Northern Sea Route with many vessels facing the prospect of being unable to move for the coming week as icebreakers have many miles to cross to get to them.
<br />
<br />Looking at ice maps from the Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, the Barents Observer, an online newspaper covering the Barents Region and the Arctic, estimates there is now an ice layer across most of the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea that is up to 30 cm thick where as in the last few years this area was ice free for October and much of November.

<br />The issue is more acute in the U.S. though it also impacts operations in Europe, Canada and Australia, with a lack of direct and indirect workers, Andre Nogueira, head of JBS SA’s U.S. division, said Thursday during the Brazilian company’s earnings call.

              HISTORIC BLIZZARDS BLAST CHINA: CENTURY-OLD RECORDS FALL, 27 “RED ALERTS” ISSUED
<br />
<br />A powerful cold wave is continuing to pound Eastern Asia this week–most notably China where heavy snowfall has effectively shutdown as host of towns and cities.
<br />
<br />China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as well as the northeastern provinces of Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang have issued a combined 27 red alerts for ‘global warming goodness’ –the highest warning level– as a number of locales register their biggest snowfalls ever in books dating back more than a century.
<br />
<br />Meteorologists in Tongliao, Inner Mongolia have called this snowstorm “an extremely random and sudden extreme weather event,” reports the globaltimes.cn. Accumulations there have reached 59 cm (23.2 inches), breaking a record held since 1951.
<br />
<br />Video captured in Tongliao on Nov 9 shows a resident opening their front door to a wall of white. While other footage shows firefighters rescuing five people after their house collapsed under the weight of the record-breaking snow:

              In late August, 89 Northeast organic dairy farmers were informed by Danone that their contracts with Horizon Organic, which the French-based company owns, will be terminated in August 2022. The affected farms in New York, Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire are part of a larger trend of decline in small dairy farms driven by milk pricing and consolidation.
<br />
<br />The Mehurens have been shipping their milk to Horizon since 2008, when they transitioned the dairy to organic. Their 45 registered Holsteins produce around 2,700 pounds of milk a day, and they also raise beef animals and a handful of sheep.
<br />
<br />“It’s a pretty big deal for a processor to withdraw from an entire region,” Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA) executive director Sarah Alexander recently told the Lewiston Sun Journal as MOFGA, along with eight other organic farming organizations, sent two petitions to Danone.
<br />
<br />“It’s potentially devastating for those farms that have lost their contracts with few if any alternate buyers,” says Katie Baildon, policy co-ordinator for Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York (NOFA-NY), another organization that sponsored the petition. “It’s also a loss for the communities that no longer have access to local organic milk.”

              Faster U.S. pig slaughtering will be allowed under a pilot program after sluggish processing pinched pork supplies and raised meat prices.
<br />
<br />Production-line speeds can be accelerated for up to a year under the new program, according to an emailed statement from U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Kate Waters. Companies will be required to enact safety measures through agreements with labor unions or employee-safety committees.

<br />Meatpackers and farmers have long been frustrated with slaughter limits that hinder production and lower the prices hogs fetch. Safety advocates argue that workers need to be better protected from potential problems ranging from bodily strains ...

              3 snow leopards die from COVID at Nebraska zoo
<br />
<br />“The zoo said it doesn’t know how the leopards contracted the virus, USA Today reported. Veterinarians treated them with steroids and antibiotics, but to no avail.  Several snow leopards across the country have tested positive for COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. Many zoos have vaccinated large percentages of their animals against the virus.”
<br />
<br />This story is 100% pure snow leopard shit.  
<br />
<br />“Animals are dirty and dangerous&#34; they&#39;ll have you believe as they kill snow leopards and force chickens farmers to move their birds inside for some &#34;new bird flu.”

<br />The truth is we have lived with animals since the dawn of time.  And this is their attempt at divorcing us from nature and from God.

              F. William Engdahl:  Now The Organized Takedown of Global Fertilizer Supply?
<br />
<br />The global energy shortages which have driven prices for coal, oil and natural gas to explosive highs in the last months are a predictable consequence of the mad pursuit of “Zero Carbon” economic policies that have seen foolish governments subsidize a growing share of electricity from unreliable solar and wind generation. One consequence has been a five-fold rise in the price of natural gas or methane across the globe. That extends from China to the EU, USA and beyond. A follow-on consequence of that natural gas shortage and price explosion is a growing crisis in world agriculture fertilizer production. This may all be no accident. It fits the WEF Great Reset Agenda of UN 2030 .
<br />
<br />When Hurricane Ida stormed across Louisiana on August 25, the largest ammonia factory complex in the world, owned by CF Industries, was closed for safety reasons and only reopened ten days later. Curiously at that point two more factories from the same CF Industries, those in the UK, announced they would close two more fertilizer plants on September 22, claiming high natural gas prices as the cause, despite the fact their Louisiana plant had just been out for ten days. The two plants supply some two-thirds of UK domestic fertilizer demand. The Government was forced to agree emergency subsidies to CF Industries to reopen one of the two plants temporarily to ease the pressures. The combined effect of the three major closures by the same group added to the crisis in world fertilizer supply. It may be just coincidence that the two largest stock owners of CF Industries are Vanguard and BlackRock.
<br />
<br />This crisis is snowballing. As of early October reported closures of ammonia fertilizer production had been announced by the giant German chemicals company, BASF, in Belgium and Germany, indefinitely. It also affects production of ammonia-based diesel fuel additive, AdBlue.
<br />
<br />… The growing crisis in world fertilizer production fits well into the UN Agenda 2030 for “sustainable” (sic) agriculture by which the globalists such as World Economic Forum of Klaus Schwab and BlackRock of Wall Street, the world’s largest private investment fund with a reported $9 trillion in assets it manages, mean dramatic reduction in meat production, replacing it with fake lab-grown meats or even insects as a protein source.

              Deer have covid!  Animals are dirty and dangerous.  Soon, you won&#39;t be able to hunt!  Feeding your family without the beast system, after all, is strictly forbidden…

<br />
<br />Hunters may face COVID-19 risk when hunting deer, officials say
<br />
<br />Wisconsin health officials said Monday that hunters should wear masks when field-dressing deer during this fall’s hunting season, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports.
<br />
<br />The Wisconsin Department of Health Services updated its guidance for deer hunters Monday, adding new advice on taking proper precautions when out in the field.
<br />
<br />“Hunters are always encouraged to use good hygiene practices when processing animals to reduce their risk of exposure to many possible disease agents,” the department said. “Incorporating a few additional measures can also help to reduce their risk of possible exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”
<br />Some of the new changes include:

<br />Wear a mask when field-dressing deer.

              Catastrophic flood warning issued for Sumas Prairie as pump system set to fail
<br />Tens of thousands of dairy cows at risk of drowning and hundreds of thousands of chickens
<br />
<br />The Fraser River was predicted to flood into the Sumas Prairie and surrounding areas on Tuesday night, potentially leading to catastrophic damage, significant risk to human life and devastation of livestock.
<br />
<br />“This event is anticipated to be catastrophic. Residents who cannot evacuate safely are asked to call 911 and report your location immediately,” said B.C.’s Public Safety Minister, in a statement issued shortly after 11 p.m. Tuesday.
<br />
<br />“I know it’s hard for farmers to leave their life’s work. But lives are more important to me right now than livestock and chickens,” Braun said.
<br />
<br />Fraser Valley farmers supply 50 per cent of all B.C.’s eggs, chickens and dairy products. There are 45,000 dairy cows in the valley, and each chicken farm has around 25,000 birds.

              Port of Vancouver CLOSES as BC flooding damages rail &amp; roads
<br />
<br />Canada&#39;s largest port by far, the port of Vancouver, has closed, as have the rails and highways connecting it to Canada, after being severely damaged in the flooding in an &#34;atmospheric river&#34; event.  The deep water port is responsible for 1/3 of Canadian imports and exports, meaning the grains that the world so badly needs from Canada are not able to get out.  And the overflow of goods from other congested North American ports are now wholly unable to get in.  Christian explains why this is not just a local catastrophe, but a worldwide one, in this Ice Age Farmer report.

              <p>Canada's largest port by far, the port of Vancouver, has closed, as have the rails and highways connecting it to Canada, after being severely damaged in the flooding in an "atmospheric river" event.  The deep water port is responsible for 1/3 of Canadian imports and exports, meaning the grains that the world so badly needs from Canada are not able to get out.  And the overflow of goods from other congested North American ports are now wholly unable to get in.  Christian explains why this is not just a local catastrophe, but a worldwide one, in this Ice Age Farmer report.

              Stunning images and stories here.  Reminds me of how people came together to move thousands of our animals out of the way of wildfires in California last year.  If only we could collectively perceive the larger agendas and threats, I know humanity would quickly put an end to the cabal.

<br />Canadian Dairy Farmers Hit Hard by Devastating ‘Atmospheric River’ Floods
<br />
<br />Canadian dairy farmers have recently been hit hard by two days of torrential rains spanning across the Pacific Northwest portion of the U.S. and into British Columbia. Some areas of the province received 8 inches of rain on Sunday, the amount that usually falls over the course of a month. The phenomenon is known as an ‘atmospheric river.’
<br />
<br />Abbotsford, B.C., is one of the areas hit the hardest. Dairy farmers in the area were told to evacuate on Tuesday as floodwaters washed over one of British Columbia’s prime agriculture areas. According to The Canadian Press, the flooding situation has forced farmers to lean on each other to save their animals.
<br />
<br />“When I see calves that are underwater that they rescued and threw in the boat to save them, on one hand it breaks my heart, but on the other hand, I’m just so impressed with our community, our farming community, and how they come together and help each other. And that’s what they’re doing,” Henry Braun, Mayor of Abbotsford, told CTV News.
<br />
<br />According to CTV News, volunteers used boats and personal watercraft to rescue animals and haul them to transport vehicles.
<br />
<br />“This is an example of an industry coming together when things really get ugly,” said Holger Schwichtenber, a Canadian dairy farmer and board member of the BC Dairy Association. “We’re doing the best that we can with the situation that we’ve been handed and it’s a tough one.”
<br />
<br />“You&#39;ve got trucks, you&#39;ve got neighbors, you&#39;ve got whoever&#39;s got a pickup truck or something to haul cattle in and you start moving them to higher ground or you&#39;ve made arrangements to get them off-site,” Schwichtenber told The Canadian Press.

              The International Grains Council (IGC) cut its forecast for 2021/22 global wheat production, partly driven by a diminished outlook for the crop in Iran. In its monthly update, the inter-governmental body reduced its 2021/22 world wheat crop outlook by 4 million tonnes to 777 million tonnes. The largest downward revision was for Iran where the crop was cut to 11.5 million tonnes, down from a previous estimate of 14.0 million. The country suffered its worst drought in 50 years during the 2021 growing season. <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/igc-cuts-forecast-for-2021-22-global-wheat-crop" rel="noopener">https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/igc-cuts-forecast-for-2021-22-global-wheat-crop</a>

              <p>IDAHO WHEAT WRAP 2021
Drought and high temperatures made for a difficult year for Idaho wheat growers this year.
“Well, as everybody knows we had a really hard year with the drought, and so our final production was down about 32%,” said Casey Chumrau, Executive Director of the Idaho Wheat Commission.
“And if you consider the fact that we were only about 1% lower on the planted acres, that really tells the story that the yields took a serious hit from that severe drought and the extreme heats that we saw over the summer. And that was across the board, across the state, and across all wheat classes.”
“The irrigated and non-irrigated people suffered, probably not the same because obviously the dryland had no real irrigation options… but the real severe temperatures also affected the irrigated growers a lot this year. So, we certainly saw some dryland areas have 40% of normal, so they certainly suffered more and that’s one advantage that we have here in Idaho is that with the irrigation, a year like this maybe we only drop 30% as opposed to 40, 50% where some of our neighbors were in that category.”
“It was a real stark difference in 2021 because it followed the record production of 2020 where we saw about 112 million bushels produced here in Idaho, and in 2021 we had just over 76 million. That was about 97 bushels per acre across all wheat classes and this year we were down to about 68 bushels per acre. So again, 32% lower than the year before and that follows record yields, record production and now we’re probably the lowest production in maybe 40 years.”
“Yeah, we’re seeing a classic example of supply and demand right now as world stocks get very tight with both lower production here in the U.S. and in Canada, and also Russia continues to adjust their final production numbers lower and lower. The world just can’t buy enough wheat so prices have really skyrocketed, and unfortunately for this region we don’t have a lot of extra bushels to take advantage of those prices this year. A lot of our growers of course, smartly had committed their bushels and sold a lot of their production with contracts and unfortunately there’s just not a lot left over this year to take advantage of those high prices.”
“We’re expecting to see at least the same amount of acres if not maybe a little bit more. Idaho has a pretty consistent crop rotation and growers seem to stick to that for the most past. They have a little bit a flexibility but we’re certainly looking for more rain. We need additional rain this year, we’ve seen a slight improvement the last few weeks with the rain that we’ve received but we’re still in really severe drought conditions, so looking for probably the same amount of acres but hoping that we’ll get some rain to help with the yields this year.”</p>

<br />
<br />Complete, engineered collapse of the food supply is here.
<br />
<br />If you are not prepared, drop what you are doing NOW and get ready.
<br />
<br />The grains aren’t getting out of North America.  This is a worldwide disaster playing out now, that no one is talking about.  A true satanic ritual mass sacrifice, in the works for generations.

              As I&#39;d warned in this report, grains are cut off from export from Canada -- HALF of the grain exports go through shipment.  HALF of the 3rd largest grain exporter shipments.  A significant chunk of an already poor harvest is stuck in the prairies:

<br />Storms at Canada’s Biggest Port Leave Grain Stuck in Prairie
<br />
<br />(Bloomberg) -- Mountains of wheat and canola are stranded in Canada after storms blocked access to the Port of Vancouver during peak shipping season.
<br />
<br />There’s no rail access to Canada’a biggest port after days of torrential rain and landslides. About 20 vessels are waiting for deliveries, while a couple hundred thousand tons of grain are stuck in transit, according to Quorum, a company that monitors Canada’s grain transportation system.
<br />
<br />It’s so bad that some exporters may even be forced to declare force majeure to avoid penalties as they won’t be able to make deliveries on time, said Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association.

              Record-high fertiliser prices in Australia could disrupt food supplies
<br />
<br />Experts believe farmers may ration use of fertiliser [IAF: as is already happening in India], leading to lower yield and higher global food prices
<br />
<br />Surging energy costs and export restrictions from usual overseas suppliers are leading to record high fertiliser prices in Australia, with analysts predicting farmers could be forced to ration its use, potentially disrupting global food supply.
<br />
<br />He said as a result, “we’ll see more rationing, as farmers will use less fertiliser because it’s too expensive” which could disrupt the global food supply chains.
<br />
<br />“Fertiliser is one of the key components ensuring we’re able to feed the world.
<br />
<br />“If farmers are using less fertiliser, there’s the potential for lower yields and if there’s lower yields there’s less food to go around.”
<br />
<br />Organic wheat, for example, yields 30% less on average than the synthetically fertilised equivalent, according to Whitelaw.

              Access to food being restricted — starts with the employees:
<br />
<br />ALDI to terminate employment of all Unvaccinated workers by March 2022
<br />
<br />The supermarket chain ALDI, has written to all employees informing them that they have until 1st March 2022, to provide proof of their Covid-19 vaccination status, and if they refuse to do so or are confirmed to be not-vaccinated then their employment will be terminated.
<br />
<br />The proposed mandate will apply to all ALDI stores in Australia, the current testing ground for the most Draconian and disproportionate restrictions, but it’s only a matter of time before they enforce the same policy throughout stores elsewhere.

              Very interesting to see ‘Little Ice Age’ coming out of the Mirror with respect to their inbound storm:
<br />
<br /> “I couldn&#39;t imagine a better weather pattern for cold weather fans, with forecast models showing a northerly straight from the Arctic next week. There is not likely to be any relief from the freezing temperatures for weeks as it will hang around -2C to -4C for much of the country.&#34;
<br />__
<br />UK weather forecast: Heavy snow to fall &#39;for days&#39; as temperatures fall to -12C
<br />The UK is set to have freezing temperatures from the start of next week which are likely to drop to as low as -12C by the end of the month while snow is predicted that will last for days
<br />
<br />Brits face freezing temperatures from the start of next week along with several days of snow, which could extend as far south as London.
<br />
<br />From there the mercury will fall dramatically and possibly hit -12C by the end of November in what has been called a “little ice age” due to Arctic plumes blowing south.

<br />The World Economic Forum’s new mini promo makes it clear that we should expect more failures of infrastructure and financial networks — not just due to cyberattacks, but now also “global warming.”
<br />
<br />A remarkably thinly veiled threat to take down society, blame your carbon footprint, justify the #ClimateLockdown.  The lashings will continue until you eat bugs.  “Thank you sir may I have another?”

              “Spring scramble” = desperately hoping things improve by spring.  They will not.  Food supply is in trouble:

<br />Fertilizer shortage may lead to spring scramble on North America&#39;s farms
<br />
<br />A global shortage of nitrogen fertilizer is driving prices to record levels, prompting North America&#39;s farmers to delay purchases and raising the risk of a spring scramble to apply the crop nutrient before planting season.
<br />
<br />Farmers apply nitrogen to boost yields of corn, canola and wheat, and higher fertilizer costs could translate into higher meat and bread prices.  Global urea prices this month topped $1,000 per tonne for the first time.

              ATH (All Time High) for grains and &#34;no end in sight” … more newsworthy than ATH for btc:

<br />GRAINS-Paris wheat sets new record highs as traders fret on world supplies (ie we are running out)
<br />
<br />Nov 23 (Reuters) - Paris wheat futures rose to new record peaks on Tuesday, while Chicago wheat consolidated near a nine-year high, as quality risks in Australia&#39;s harvest and a deterioration in U.S. growing conditions kept attention on tightening global supplies.
<br />
<br />On Paris-based Euronext, December wheat BL2Z1 rose to a new all-time high (ATH) for a Euronext contract at 312.25 euros ($351.06) a tonne.
<br />
<br />&#34;There is no end in sight to the price rally in the near future,&#34; Commerzbank said of wheat, citing factors including harvest rain in Australia, flood disruption to Canadian exports and the prospect of rising export taxes in Russia.
<br />
<br />In Australia, heavy rains in eastern regions are threatening to damage crops, adding to quality concerns after early harvest results in the west showed disappointing protein content. Dry conditions in some U.S. winter wheat belts have also fuelled early worries about next year&#39;s harvests.

              Refinery that supplies estimated one-third of Lower Mainland gas runs out of crude oil
<br />
<br />Calgary-based Parkland Corp.’s Burnaby refinery, which supplies an estimated one-third of the gas to the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island said Tuesday it has stopped processing operations because it had run out of crude oil due to the Trans Mountain pipeline shutdown after last week’s catastrophic flooding.
<br />
<br />“Parkland maintains some crude-oil storage on-site, so up until today, it has been able to continue operations,” said Kent Fellows, a professor at the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy.
<br />
<br />“Trans Mountain would also normally be shipping about 27,000 barrels per day of gasoline and diesel from refineries near Edmonton to the Lower Mainland in B.C.,” said Fellows.

              Flood waters are highly toxic — and much of the affected BC farmland now needs remediation:
<br />__
<br />
<br /> Concerns over contaminated floodwater, decaying animals from Sumas Prairie
<br />…
<br />“You can’t get them water. You have no grain. Your feed is compromised,” he said.
<br />
<br />“I’ve never seen anything like this before. God willing, we never see anything like this again in our lifetime.”
<br />
<br />Thousands of cows were rescued from Sumas Prairie, but the B.C. Dairy Association also reports about 500 cattle have died there during the floods. More than 100,000 chickens also did not survive.
<br />
<br />One of the problems now facing farmers is what to do with the decaying animals.  “We’ve got to get them out and dispose of them in the proper way,” Verdonk said.
<br />
<br />Another pressing problem for farmers is the floodwaters that continue to make fields in eastern Sumas Prairie look like lakes and have turned roads into rivers. “This water’s contaminated. There’s been dead chickens, dead cows, dead other farm animals. There’s manure pits,” he explained.
<br />
<br />That contaminated water is also top-of-mind for blueberry farmers with flooded fields, “The plants roots are not getting oxygen. The water is toxic with all the contaminants. The chemicals, the manure’s in there. The fuel’s in there,&#34; said blueberry farmer Harry Sidhu.
<br />
<br />He said his family has two farms still under eight feet of water. 
<br />
<br />“The soil itself, it’s contaminated. It’s going to need to be remediated,” he said, adding that thousands of acres of berries will need to be ripped out and replaced.
<br />
<br />“It’s catastrophic. It’s horrific,” he said. “We need immediate relief.”

              WHO says it&#39;s time for countries to have &#39;healthy debate&#39; about mandatory vaccination
<br />
<br />The World Health Organisation has suggested it is time for countries to have a conversation about mandatory COVID-19 vaccines, saying: &#34;It&#39;s a healthy debate to have.&#34;
<br />
<br />Robb Butler, executive director for WHO Europe, told Kay Burley on Sky News: &#34;Mandatory vaccination can, but doesn&#39;t always increase uptake.&#34;
<br />
<br />However, he suggested countries - and individuals - should now be thinking about the issue.

              German Power Prices Soar As Arctic Blast To Bring &#34;Significant Snow&#34;
<br />
<br />Europe&#39;s first cold spell of the heating season has arrived, pressuring power prices higher as freezing temperatures ushers in increased power demand to heat building structures across the central-west region. 
<br />
<br />German day-ahead power prices jumped to the second-highest level ever, 273.89 euros per megawatt-hour. Day-ahead power prices are also higher in France and Netherlands. 
<br />
<br />Weather models for Germany show between Nov. 24 - Dec. 4. -- the average temperature will hover well below the 30-year norm or around 30-35 degrees. Low temps will dip into the mid 20 degrees Fahrenheit. 
<br />
<br />The cold snap will test Germany and the other parts of Europe&#39;s energy systems already under stress due to the lowest natural gas stockpiles since 2013. There appears to be no relief in dwindling gas flows into the continent as German energy regulators decided to suspend the Nord Stream 2 pipeline certification process last week. With every hiccup the Russian to German pipeline faces, natural gas prices increase, forcing power prices higher. There&#39;s also the issue that more power generation has to be diverted from alternative energy sources to fossil fuels due to unreliability: 
<br />
<br />&#34;Wind generation and temperatures below the seasonal norm are increasing gas-for-power and heating demand; this provides bullish pressure to day-ahead contract,&#34; Inspired Energy said in a report.
<br />
<br />Europe is staring into a perfect storm of forces that could spark a winter of discontent and continue socio-economic chaos on the continent. EU politicians won&#39;t publicly say, but they need Putin&#39;s gas to avert an energy crisis this coming winter that could sweep many politicians out of power due to uncontrollable energy inflation.

              Return of Mao-Era Coal Coupons Show China’s Crisis Isn’t Over
<br />
<br />A local government in China is resurrecting coal coupons -- a relic of Mao Zedong’s planned economy days -- to ensure its citizens have access to heating fuel as they brace for a bitter winter.
<br />
<br />Shuozhou, located in the heart of coal country in Shanxi province, has distributed coupons to 47,000 families to help them purchase the heating fuel, the official China Youth Daily reported on Wednesday. Each coupon is good for two tons of subsidized coal, enough for each household to last through the winter and early spring.

              CEO of commodity trading giant Trafigura (and the media) keep beating the drum about rolling blackouts across Europe: &#34;Europe is at risk of power outages this winter due to insufficient gas reserves and over the long-term, oil could rise above $100 a barrel.”
<br />
<br />Yet the rep from ENTSO-E, the bloc&#39;s electricity network operators, says the media is hyping up the risk, &#34;Blackouts are extreme and very rare events in Europe,&#34; said the group&#39;s spokesperson, adding that the last major grid outage in Europe happened nearly two decades ago. Since then, the continent&#39;s grids are better connected, allowing electricity and gas to flow easily between countries.
<br />
<br />Note that Trafigura is a WEF partner — <a href="https://www.weforum.org/organizations/trafigura" rel="noopener">https://www.weforum.org/organizations/trafigura</a> — note he is even pictured here in the Reuters article in front of a WEF logo! A not-so-subtle nod, part of the club...

<br />What does he know that the industry experts don’t?  What will happen to the EU energy supply this winter (and who will do it)?

<br />I don’t know — but I do know you should have water, heat and cooking on hand.

              Building on previous post, Survival Lilly did an excellent interview on the state of the European grid, as Germany shuts down additional coal and nuclear plants, they can’t simply be “turned back on” because of a lack of long-term investment in operation:  replacement parts, fuel rods, training personnel.
<br />
<br />Also that the grid would take time to turn back on, then comms, then supply chain ... there would necessarily be lasting impact -- and shortages -- even if power was restored quickly.

<br />All in the name of Global Warming…

              UMN’s Deep Winter Greenhouses:
<br />
<br />A Deep Winter Greenhouse (DWG) is a passive-solar greenhouse that relies on energy from the sun to heat the building instead of more traditional heating sources.
<br />
<br />There are a few important aspects of the design that make this possible. DWGs are built in an east-west position, with a glazing wall that faces south. This wall is specially angled, depending on latitude, to get the most possible solar energy on the coldest day of the year. The sun heats the air inside which is blown underground with a fan and stored in rocks. This heated rock bed is a thermal mass that acts as a heat battery and stores heat for when it is needed at night.
<br />
<br />DWGs in Minnesota can be used to grow crops that thrive with minimal light, providing year-round production capacity for small-scale farmers and gardeners. Crops well-suited to DWG production include a variety of lettuces, herbs, brassicas, asian greens and sprouts.

              We&#39;ve run out of alternatives&#39;: Vets carrying out pig abortions as labour shortage crisis continues
<br />
<br />A shortage of butchers means that meat processors have been taking around 25% fewer animals than contracted, leaving farmers facing impossible choices to avoid overcrowding and the consequent breach of welfare standards.
<br />
<br />Vets and farmers have made the &#34;soul-destroying&#34; move of carrying out abortion procedures on pigs because they have &#34;run out of alternatives&#34;.
<br />
<br />It comes as many can no longer cope with the backlog of animals on farms. The National Pig Association (NPA) suggests 11% of farmers have already culled healthy pigs, with a further 10% saying they will need to do so within the next two weeks.
<br />
<br />Officially only 16,000 such kills have been logged with the NPA, but this figure is based on self-reporting and is likely a gross underestimate, with the reality more likely thousands, possibly tens of thousands killed but not destined for the food chain a week.
<br />
<br />Farmers, vets and the industry alike have said what&#39;s currently happening is the worst culling of healthy animals in the history of UK pig farming, describing the situation as &#34;sickening&#34;, &#34;unforgivable&#34; and a situation caused by &#34;human error&#34;.

              China has gone dark as far as offering visibility into shipping vessels and #SupplyChain — this is a bigger deal than most realize. 
<br />
<br />Possible precursor for war:
<br />
<br />“Terrestrial AIS signals typically provide the greatest data coverage and insight into shipping in Chinese ports, so this data decline could significantly impact ocean supply chain visibility across China, one of the world’s major importers of coal and iron ore and exporters of containers.”
<br />
<br />Furthermore, Ms Cook noted, the shipping industry has become increasingly reliant on AIS data for a broad range of functions, including route planning, port logistics and congestion analysis.
<br />
<br />“Ultimately, the significant reductions we are seeing in the count of vessels signalling in China will reduce the ability to accurately monitor vessel activity, and this could have knock-on effects to already squeezed global supply chains,” she added.

              <p>Vessel location data from China has been greatly reduced, impacting maritime supply chain visibility. The tracking signal, known as Automatic Identification System (AIS), is used globally by the shipping industry to transmit data on vessel location and identity. However, China’s new personal information protection law that came into effect this month has reportedly prompted domestic providers to stop sharing AIS data with foreign companies. AIS can be transmitted from coastal networks, satellites ...</p>

              Amid concerns of food security, grain prices hike in China
<br />
<br />For some time now Beijing has been emphasising the importance of food security. This is because grain prices in China have increased and the relations with some exporting countries are not so good now.
<br />
<br />China is expected to roll out support in order to counter price volatility in both domestic and international markets. The state-run Economic Daily has reported that prices of corn and wheat have soared. However, the price of rice has fallen below the minimum purchase price. 
<br />
<br />The media further added that the situation could get worse as the prices would continue to increase due to continuous rainfall and unusually cold winter in northern China.

              Will There Be A Diesel Shortage?
<br />
<br />US stockpiles of diesel fuel currently sit at a 20-year low. This comes at a time when Americans are doing extensive online shopping and the supply chain is struggling to keep up. And indeed, it’s not even the only diesel fuel shortage currently developing; propane stockpiles are also dwindling.
<br />
<br />Issues caused by the deep freeze in Texas greatly reduced production, causing many refineries to shut down or heavily reduce production. This greatly impacted diesel stockpiles, and we’re likely feeling delayed effects from that now. 
<br />
<br />The so-called “Great Resignation” could also be contributing. As unprecedented numbers of Americans quit their jobs, employers are struggling to fill positions. And as they struggle to hire and keep drivers to haul fuel, companies are surely struggling to meet demand.

              #1 FAQ:  Where is a good place to be during #GrandSolarMinimum?
<br />
<br />My answer:  First, check out these maps of how the climate changed during previous grand minima:
<br />
<br />     <a href="http://wiki.iceagefarmer.com/wiki/Strategic_Relocation:_Maps" rel="noopener">http://wiki.iceagefarmer.com/wiki/Strategic_Relocation:_Maps</a>
<br />
<br />Use these as starting point to inform a more holistic process:  there are a number of considerations beyond basic geography/climate that need to be considered.  My recommendation is to run through an exercise like this as a tool to organize your thoughts:
<br />
<br />- Make a list of what is important to you: proximity to community/family.  growing more crops vs. pasture for animals.  etc.
<br />
<br />- Craft a risk analysis for each area considered: volcanic/seismic, water extremes (drought/flood), frosts ruining growing season, large population nearby, resource availability.
<br />
<br />- Rank the risks:  How likely are the risks?  How tolerant of each are you?  ( i.e., if you are chiefly raising animals, maybe a late frost doesn&#39;t matter.  if you are skilled builder with earthbags, an earthquake may not be end of world.).
<br />
<br />Now we have a risk matrix.  Instead of just picking of a place and then enumerating the reasons it would be a bad choice (we are all likely quite good at that by now, but it gets us nowhere), now you are starting to work to match your own risk preferences against the candidate areas, and understanding WHY an area is a good balance for you/your family.
<br />
<br />(because nothing is perfect)
<br />
<br />Open questions:  What has worked for you?  Why are you where you are?  How is it working?  How confident are you?
