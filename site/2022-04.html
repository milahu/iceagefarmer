Minnesota poultry sales and exhibitions temporarily banned for 31 days
<br />
<br />“Due to multiple detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) [Bird Flu]in Minnesota and surrounding states, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health is issuing a 31-day statewide ban on all poultry sales and exhibitions effective Friday, April 1 through Sunday, May 1. The ban includes all poultry community sales, swaps, fairs, exhibitions and other events where poultry and susceptible birds are brought together. The current H5N1 HPAI outbreak in Minnesota poses a high risk to poultry but low risk to the public and there is no food safety concern for consumers.

And overnight, food prices are rising up to 50% in Germany.  It’s happening fast:
<br />
<br />“German retailer Aldi Nord will raise its prices by an average of 20-50% due to an increase in production costs, local media reported on Sunday.
<br />From Monday onwards, meat, sausage products, and butter will be &#34;significantly more expensive,&#34; a company spokesman told German press agency DPA, adding that the price hikes in various products were necessary due to the rise in manufacturing costs.

<br />Crop production in Ukraine this year could be down anywhere from 20% to 80%, significant,” he said. European farmers have been reducing fertilizer application rates and are adjusting the way they use the products.
<br />
<br />“What it means is that we’re going to see lower yields going into the year ahead, so there’s going to be less grain as we come out of this growing season, and therefore high grain prices going over into 2023,” Claxton said.

European food companies are STOPPING PRODUCTION. Even the people who think food comes from the supermarket should be raising their eyebrows and STARTING GARDENS at this point!
<br />
<br />“Rising costs force one in three food manufacturers to reduce production
<br />
<br />If food retailers do not accept price increases, one in three food companies may reduce or stop production. The unprecedented cost increases for energy, raw materials and packaging are undermining the profitability of food producers.
<br />
<br />Many food manufacturers run into serious financial problems and are forced to shut down production lines if supermarkets do not respond to their demand for price increases, warns the federation of the Belgian food industry (Fevia). One manufacturer in three has already or plans to reduce production.
<br />
<br />“electricity bills have doubled in one year, and those for gas have even tripled. Commodity prices also peak: wheat and maize became 50% more expensive, eggs 27%, sunflower oil 40%. Cardboard for packaging now costs 25% more, plastic 30%.” 
<br />
<br />“Within two weeks, we may have to shut down a quarter of our production lines,” says Colruyt CEO Jean-Luc Colon

Nigel Palmer’s work on regenerative gardening &amp; homemade soil amendments is top notch.  I have reached out to him for an interview, to teach folks how to feed their soil without  commercial fertilizers.
<br />
<br />In the meantime, check out his video on extracting minerals from egg shells, or find his book (buy it NOT on amazon if possible!):
<br />
<br />The Regenerative Grower&#39;s Guide to Garden Amendments: Using Locally Sourced Materials to Make Mineral and Biological Extracts and Ferment
<br />
<br />Imagine every home having a nice garden and backyard flock of chickens or quail, an elegant closed system with soil in top condition, fed composted manure and minerals from egg shells…
<br />
<br />   [ Open question:  who else would you recommend interviewing? ]

BIRD FLU: the Next Pandemic ?

As hundreds of millions of birds are killed due to Bird Flu PCR “outbreaks,” Europe is warning of chicken and egg shortages, and many states have now outright banned the sale of chicks to the public. The largest egg producer in the US has culled birds and fired its workers.

Blizzard incoming for US, not good for producers:
<br />
<br />“farmers are weathering yet another challenge as they prepare for a blizzard that could bring 50 mph winds and up to 30&#34; of snow.
<br />Central North Dakota seems to be the bullseye for the blizzard, with forecasts showing that area could see more than two feet of snow, along with winds that could cause white-out conditions.
<br />
<br />“After these calves get 2’ of snow dumped on them and then it stays cold, it&#39;s hard,” says Langley. “It&#39;s going to be hard to keep them healthy. It&#39;s going to be hard to keep things alive.”

China&#39;s corn planting facing delays as lockdowns leave farmers stuck in cities
<br />
<br />Planting of corn in one of China’s major producing areas could be delayed as many of the region’s millions of farmers struggle to return home from temporary city jobs because of strict coronavirus lockdowns.
<br />
<br />Any delay to planting could hit output in the world’s No. 2 corn producer, where corn prices are already hovering at record levels, and government support for soybeans also threatens to reduce growing of the grain.
<br />
<br />China’s northeastern provinces, its bread basket, have endured weeks of restrictions on movement, with the toughest measures in Jilin province where COVID-19 cases soared in early March.
<br />With the critical time for sowing grain fast approaching, some farmers remain stuck and are getting increasingly worried, despite recent government pledges to tackle the issue.
<br />
<br />“I need to tend my land immediately, but I can’t go back. I am so anxious,” a farmer surnamed Wang told Reuters on Tuesday from Changchun, the capital of Jilin.
<br />
<br />The problem highlights the challenge for China in balancing its strict zero-COVID policy with its high priority on food security.
<br />Fertiliser supplies to the region have also been disrupted by the transport curbs, and farmers are already facing record prices of the crop nutrient as well as diesel and other costs.

Bird Flu off the charts compared to 2015 outbreak:
<br />
<br />&#34;We are above and beyond the rate of spread, we saw in 2015. 
<br />&#34;Last time, 81 percent of the cases were in the fourth and fifth month, as things exploded. What chicken egg prices did last time affected the market for years. We are two months into the outbreak now, and the safety protocols haven&#39;t worked. I don&#39;t want to be a Chicken Little, but I think it&#39;s going to be worse than last time,

Beef shortage too? It’s not just chicken:
<br />
<br />“By looking at production in key beef producing regions, we can see that a range of global and local factors may limit the supply onto the world market, with obvious implications for food security.”
<br />
<br />Global supplies of beef will remain tight for the short to medium term.
<br />
<br />This is due to below average production in the EU and US specifically, firm domestic demand in the US, and elevated import demand from China and the rest of Asia.

Maine potato growers expecting hit after Belfast fire
<br />
<br />Latest example of spontaneous combustion of our food supply: see #fire tag:
<br />
<br />The large fire at a potato processing plant in Belfast is expected to have ripple effects across Maine’s agriculture industry.
<br />
<br />The Penobscot McCrum plant processed Maine-grown spuds into products sold around the country.
<br />
<br />A fire tore through the building Thursday morning, destroying the facility and leaving the 138 people who work there without a job.
<br />
<br />Don Flannery, executive director of the Maine Potato Board, said the loss of the plant will have a negative impact on the state’s potato growers. “There are producers across the state who have contracts with the plant who may need to make adjustments to their 2022 growing plans after the fire.

Bird Flu outbreak forces Quebec duck farm to kill 150,000 birds, permanently lay off 300 employees.
<br />
<br />A Quebec duck-farming operation in the Eastern Townships says three of its facilities have been devastated by avian flu, forcing it to slaughter 150,000 birds and lay off nearly 300 employees.
<br />
<br />It will likely take six to 12 months and possibly several million dollars to fully restore the company&#39;s operations, Angela Anderson of Brome Lake Ducks said in an interview Wednesday.

Experts warn “Stop filling your bird feeders” to “help stop bird flu.”

China reports 2 new human cases of H5N6 bird flu
<br />
<br />Two people who are hospitalized in critical condition in mainland China have tested positive for H5N6 bird flu, raising the number of cases so far this year to 19, officials say. The spike in human cases has led to calls for increased surveillance.
<br />
<br />The first case, a 28-year-old man from Puyang in Henan Province, developed symptoms on March 18 after exposure to live poultry, according to the Hong Kong Health Department. He was hospitalized the next day and remains in critical condition.
<br />
<br />The other case, a 53-year-old woman from Zhenjiang City in Jiangsu Province, fell ill on March 24 after visiting a live poultry market. She was hospitalized two days later and is still in critical condition.
<br />
<br />The Chinese government disclosed last month that a 12-year-old girl and a 79-year-old man died of H5N6 bird flu in December. Both lived in Liuzhou, a city in the Guangxi region, and visited a live poultry market before falling ill.
<br />

FOOD SUPPLY SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTING
<br />
<br />I’m so glad this is catching people’s attention.  One thing to note:  it’s been going on for YEARS.  
<br />
<br />Here is a map I’d created in 2020 when the suspicious fires at food processing plants started ticking up, and then it became impossible to keep up!  
<br />
<br />You can click each pin to find a farm, or food distribution center, or warehouse, or grain elevator, or the port of Beirut going up in flames — and each whittles away the resilience of our food supply chain.
<br />
<br />The 20 fires in the last 2 months here (which are not even on this map yet), while noteworthy, are just the latest acceleration!

BREAKING: FBI warns farmers that hackers are launching cyberattacks on food supply (even as people catch on to explosions at food processors)
<br />
<br />Video report forthcoming. - @iceagefarmer
<br />
<br />___
<br />“The FBI is warning farmers of potential hackers targeting the ag industry.
<br />
<br />The agency said cyber-criminals might be more likely to go after farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons.
<br />
<br />Six grain companies were targeted last fall, and two others have already been attacked this year, authorities said.
<br />
<br />A major disruption of grain production would impact the entire food chain, something criminals take advantage of when trying to extort growers.

Italy launches a system similar to the Chinese regime that gives points to those who have ‘virtuous behaviors’
<br />
<br />The first European social credit system is being developed in Italy, which is controversial because of its similarities to China’s infamous social credit system. This application, already operating in Rome, gives reward points to citizens who have ‘good behavior.’ 
<br />
<br />The so-called “Smart Citizen Wallet” system will reward people with points for things like recycling, using public transportation, managing energy well, and anything else that the state deems worthy of rewards.
<br />
<br />Those who use the application and have what they call “virtuous behaviors” will be rewarded with gifts, such as discounts on purchases and services, cultural activities free of charge, etc., which are then redeemed for the points obtained. 
<br />
<br />According to the local newspaper of Bologna, Corriere di Bologna, the application is voluntary. It will be launched this autumn in the northern Italian city while it is in its experimental stage in Rome.

Rabobank now links your spending to carbon emissions
<br />
<br />Since Friday, Rabobank customers can see how much CO2 they emit based on their spending in the bank’s app.

<br />[IAF: If spending == carbon, a zero carbon policy implies zero economic activity.

Note also - they are making the case for even MORE data on what you EAT:
<br />
<br />“Food accounts for a third of man’s climate impact, but the figures available on this subject are very general. “And you can do a lot in eating habits,” says Schöne. Buying Dutch apples instead of Brazilian bananas immediately reduces your footprint significantly. “But that person needs to know how much CO2 emissions are associated with the product they’re buying.”
<br />
<br />This is why the climate expert is calling on the firm to better map the products that cause the most emissions, so that consumers can make better choices and the data collected by Rabobank is more reliable.

Northern Ireland faces loss of 1 million sheep and cattle to meet climate targets
<br />
<br />How does this make sense as food shortages are announced?  Only if it is deliberately making things worse.  We are under attack:
<br />
<br />“Northern Ireland will need to lose more than 1 million sheep and cattle to meet its new legally binding climate emissions targets, according to an industry-commissioned analysis.
<br />
<br />The large-scale reduction in farm animals comes after the passing of the ​​jurisdiction’s first ever climate act, requiring the farming sector to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reduce methane emissions by almost 50% over the same period.
<br />
<br />    Zero Carbon = Zero Animals.  Hence the WEF’s “Post Animal Econoy”
<br />
<br />[IAF: Biden’s USDA is also charged with zero emissions agriculture mandate]

But it’s not just animals — even grains are being called “extreme emitters” of greenhouse gasses.  FAO tells Canada to grow less grains!  Ridiculous:
<br />
<br />Canada:  Feds target cereals as major emitter
<br />
<br />Ag Canada says cutting such emissions is critical because the federal government wants to reduce fertilizer related emissions 30 percent by 2030.
<br />
<br />“Canada’s emission intensity for cereals in 2017 is higher than those reported for the United States, the European Union and (other regions).”  The discussion paper includes a table, using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to emphasize that Canadian cereal crops produce the highest amount of nitrous oxide emissions in the developed world.

Diesel shortage in Punjab impacting wheat harvest/sowing:
<br />
<br />Diesel shortage may hit wheat harvesting and sowing of Kharif crops as farmers are queuing up at filling stations to get oil supplies in various areas of Punjab.
<br />
<br />Reports particularly from south Punjab districts suggest that diesel is either not available or its supplies are short at filling stations. Farmers who have harvested wheat and are waiting for its threshing are worried that if diesel supplies are not stabilised, their crop may be damaged because of high winds and possible rains in the month of May.
<br />
<br />Farmers from various regions blame panic buying for the shortage on the rumours that the oil prices may be increased from May 1. “Some of our colleagues are trying to hoard the oil in anticipation of an increase in its prices, putting stress on the supplies,” says Fayyaz from Chishtian.

War on Food Goes Hot: FBI warns cyberattacks on farms -- One farm stands up
<br />
<br />The food wars have gone hot -- and even the mainstream is noticing.  Even as the fires and explosions destroying our food supply are broadly reported, the FBI warns of cyberattacks on farming infrastructure.  As this awareness grows, one farm has stood up to NY state, refusing to comply with Bird Flu orders.  Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

BREAKING: Massive fire engulfs large sausage factory in UK, somehow already 95% burned by time crew arrived.
<br />
<br />IAF comment:  these fires are now at ridiculous levels.  Our food supply is spontaneously combusting at ludicrous speed.
<br />
<br />By that I mean this:  it is now reaching a level of “Revelation of the Method,” where even Tucker is speaking about the destruction of our food supply, yet multiple large facilities continue to erupt in flames every day.
<br />
<br />It is unbelievable, like the poorly constructed narratives of many false flags, such as paper passports being magically found after 9/11…
<br />
<br />The fires become an outright mockery of those of us who are paying attention.  We are burning your food supply, and even telling you we&#39;re doing it, and you can&#39;t stop us!  
<br />
<br />——  Ignore the mockery -- keep planting that garden. ——
<br />
<br />“A large fire at a sausage factory is being tackled by 10 crews from both Essex and Hertfordshire. Thick plumes of smoke can be seen across the town and the fire service has warned people to stay indoors and keep windows shut.
<br />
<br />The fire service said when crews arrived the building was 95% alight and 100% smoke-logged.

<br />Materials including starch, packaging, fats, and oils were the most challenging for General Mills to find, affecting the multinational brand&#39;s pizza, hot snacks, cereal, and refrigerated baked goods.  Part of the issue is a global supply shortage resulting from the war in Ukraine, which has put additional strain on oils and starch. Those two ingredients are usually made of wheat—which is heavily exported by Russia and Ukraine. Both countries are halting sending resources out right now.

Lab-grown meat and insects &#39;good for planet and health&#39;
<br />
<br />The BBC not even bothering to decorate the propaganda, echoing nearly verbatum the the EAT-Lancet commission. “Food is the single strongest lever to optimize human health and environmental sustainability on Earth.”
<br />
<br />__
<br />
<br />Dining on the likes of lab-grown meat or ground-up insects could lead to big savings in carbon emissions and water, as well as freeing up land for nature.
<br />
<br />Scientists say pressures on the planet could fall by more than 80% with such foods, compared with the typical European diet.
<br />
<br />They say switching meat, dairy and other animal products for alternative foods could reduce these impacts by more than 80%, while providing a more complete range of essential nutrients than a purely vegetarian or vegan diet.

Planting delays around the US:  Wisconsin
<br />
<br />Freeze warnings in southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois might delay planting for farmers, gardeners
<br />
<br />“Planting corn seeds won’t begin until May, but the cold weather might push it back if this weather continues,” said Jordan Schuler, the regional crops educator with UW Extension. Schuler’s region includes Rock and Jefferson counties in Wisconsin.
<br />
<br />“I was told that the soil temperature is around 48 degrees, and farmers like it to be around 50 to 55 degrees,” Cain said. “The seeds won’t germinate until the soil gets warm enough.”

Planting delays around the US: Illinois 
<br />
<br />RAIN CONTINUES TO DELAY PLANTING
<br />
<br />While eighty-degree temperatures over the weekend warmed up southern Illinois soils, frequent rains are still causing planting delays.
<br />
<br />For some farmers in the region, including Lance Panzer of Waltonville, the answer to how much planting they have done is, “None whatsoever.”
<br />
<br />He tells Brownfield their tillage equipment and planters are hooked up and ready to roll, but “Just about the time we are ready to go, every five days it seems to rain again and that’s how it has been all spring. And every time it rains you can reset the clock another 7 days.”
<br />
<br />He says they really need seven days without rain before soils are dry enough for planting, and looking at data from his on-farm trials, he will be concerned if they cannot get some seed in the ground by May 10th.
<br />
<br />“After we get past the 10th of May, we are shaving yield off of both beans and corn.”

Planting delays around the US:  Iowa
<br />
<br />Iowa’s spring planting season continues to be delayed, now falling well behind recent years and the five-year average after several rounds of heavy rain and severe weather prevented many from getting into the fields over the warmer weekend.
<br />
<br />Average 4-inch soil temperatures remain below the 50-degree target to begin planting corn in Northern Iowa, and while southern and southeast Iowa have finally warmed up, planting is only just getting underway.
<br />
<br />Monday’s crop progress report from the USDA didn’t even put a percentage on amount of acres planted through April 24th. For comparison, in 2021, 20 percent of Iowa’s corn crop was already in the ground at this point, with 27 percent in the ground in North Central Iowa, where soil temperatures and growing degree days are well short of targets. Even more starkly, even last year’s 20 percent progress still fell a day behind the 5-year average.
<br />
<br />Now, as the calendar is set to turn to May, more rain in the forecast could continue to frustrate farmers, even in areas where ground temperatures have finally hit acceptable levels. Showers and storms on Saturday could bring another soaking rain with widespread totals potentially at an inch or more, with even more rain and storms possible in the long term, arriving Tuesday or Wednesday next week.

Latest USDA report had tight ending stocks across several grains &amp; oilseeds.
<br />
<br />“A bumper crop is needed.”
<br />
<br />The cold temps and excessive rains have kept farmers out of the fields, delaying planting.  When considered also with fertilizer and other input shortages … a bumper crop can not be expected, to say the least.
<br />
<br />Sadly, the increasing food prices and availability issues we see today are only a tease of what is ahead.

My friends,
<br />
<br />As the engineered food crisis has gained traction in mainstream awareness, I started writing a pamphlet/book with the purpose of helping to shepherd people out of the grocery store and into growing food as part of an emergent, decentralized food system.
<br />
<br />The book is a run through the most important things I&#39;ve learned through years of conversations about food sovereignty, in a context of immediately standing up systems to endure (and fight) the technocratic takeover of food.  &#34;Assume crash position!&#34;
<br />
<br />I wanted to share this news early, rather than be too quiet the new project.  If you are interested in the book or have any thoughts on what belongs in a &#34;victory garden lightning course,&#34; I&#39;d love to hear from you!  Drop a comment or email.
<br />
<br />Warmly,
<br />Christian

Australia: pork supply set to plunge as Japanese encephalitis detected across piggeries
<br />
<br />Experts say Japanese encephalitis will impact pork supply as infected piggeries experience production losses of up to 80 per cent.  There are now 30 New South Wales piggeries affected by the mosquito-borne virus and 11 people have been infected, with three deaths nationwide.
<br />
<br />&#34;It&#39;s also the mental health impact on the people, because there&#39;s been a lot of stillborn or abortions or abnormalities in piglets … which can be very stressful seeing … day in, day out.&#34;
<br />
<br />The disease has no impact on the safety of consuming pork, but Dr Britton said production losses were likely to affect availability.
<br />
<br />&#34;I think it will affect the supply of pork, because it has impacted a number of the bigger properties as well as some of the smaller ones,&#34; she said.
