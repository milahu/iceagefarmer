Food and hunger are taking center stage as the focus is shifted from covid to food / &#34;climate emergency&#34;:  this bill is a part of Gov. Northam’s “Road Map to End Hunger,” which states that an additional 445,000 Virginians became food insecure during the pandemic.
<br />
<br />_
<br />
<br />On Tuesday, Gov. Ralph Northam visited the Capital Area Food Bank to sign a bill to put more meals on tables for food-insecure Virginians.
<br />
<br />The legislation helps local food banks to directly purchase the items from the farmers and onto the tables of families in need.
<br />
<br />“This program that we have now will make it easier for many of us to work with Virginia farmers. We had a shipment just this morning from Waterpenny Farm of 800,000 pounds of just terrific produce,” said Radha Muthiah, President &amp; CEO of Capital Area Food Bank.
<br />
<br />The bill will support families financially recovering from the pandemic and those who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). First Lady Pamela Northam also referenced the administration’s efforts to provide the farm to table foods to students.
<br />
<br />“Growing brains need full tummies. You can’t learn when you’re hungry,” the first lady said.
<br />
<br />Gov. Northam says it’s a win-win, putting money into the pockets of local farmers while providing quality food to families. The bill comes after Northam allocated $7 million in CARES Act funding to Virginia food banks to aid those who rely on food assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
<br />
<br />“Prior to COVID-19, 9% of our population in Virginia were food insecure. During COVID-19, that number at times went up to over 20%,” said Northam.

Just want to observe as a local: there have been numerous fires across NorCal already, some reaching hundreds of acres.  None receives real media coverage.  But somehow a few of these -- like the LAVA FIRE -- even in the first few hours, when still under &lt; 30 acres, hit the Sacramento Bee / other papers.  
<br />
<br />I wondered -- is this one special somehow?  Sure enough, within a few hours, it had been branded the LAVA FIRE and had been picked up by national media.
<br />
<br />And indeed, by the next morning, the &#34;lava fire&#34; has exploded to 10,000 acres.  Today it&#39;s over 20,000.  
<br />
<br />Conditions are horribly dry, it is tinder box everywhere.  When some moron with an angle grinder sparks up a blaze, CalFire is on it and often contained remarkably quickly, and no one mentions it.  
<br />
<br />But when it&#39;s branded.  And when the media picks up on it.  These stories are NAMED and TIMED with significant esoteric overtones (remember the &#34;devil winds&#34; that prompted a fire burning Paradise, CA?).  And as the governors and Biden have just announced, we are on the verge of &#34;historic&#34; fire ATTACKS across the west to drive this idea of a drought/wildfire/food shortage &#34;climate emergency&#34; in the media.
<br />
<br />Heads up.  We are under attack.

Bugs to the rescue: using insects as animal feed could cut deforestation 
<br />
<br />WWF (!) study suggests adopting insect protein in pig and poultry feed could reduce UK soya imports by a fifth by ... 2050 !
<br />
<br />Insect protein in animal feed could replace 20% of the UK’s soya imports by 2050, according to a report by WWF.
<br />
<br />The study, which sets out a plan for the UK to accelerate the adoption of insect protein in animal feed, also found that just under half of the demand for the protein could be met by British producers.
<br />
<br />Soya has become a key ingredient of animal feed but rising demand for the crop has been linked to deforestation in South America.
<br />
<br />More than 1m tonnes of soya used by UK livestock farmers in 2019 could have been linked to deforestation, according to estimates.
<br />
<br />“We’ve been looking at insect protein as an alternative to soya for 18 months. We always thought it had huge potential but to say that it will be able to reduce up to a fifth of our soya imports was huge.”

              <div>On 11th March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To date, there are rapidly spreading new “variants of concern” of SARS-CoV-2, the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), the South African (B.1.351) or Brasilian (P.1) variant. All of them contain multiple mutations in the ACE2 receptor recognition site of the spike protein, compared to the original Wuhan sequence, which is of great concern, because of their potential for immune escape. Here we report on the efficacy of common dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale ) to block protein-protein interaction of spike S1 to the human ACE2 cell surface receptor. This could be shown for the original spike D614, but also for its mutant forms (D614G, N501Y, and mix of K417N, E484K, N501Y) in human HEK293-hACE2 kidney and A549-hACE2-TMPRSS2 lung cells. High molecular weight compounds in the water-based extract account for this effect. Infection of the lung cells using SARS-CoV-2…</div>

Johns Hopkins, IBM launch AI chatbot to combat COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy
<br />
<br />Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins University and IBM Research unveiled a new artificial intelligence-powered chatbot July 1 that the two organizations developed to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. 
<br />
<br />The chabot, named Vira, aims to get resources to people who are vaccine hesitant, especially young adults from communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

<br />A Funding Frenzy And SPAC Listings Are Fueling The Indoor Growing Industry. But Does It Make Financial Sense?
<br />
<br />With billions in funding, yet limited sales, the indoor growing industry is hitting an inflection point. 
<br />
<br />A stunning $1.9 billion in funding poured into the industry globally in 2020, according to Pitchbook, which amounts to more than the industry pulled in over the past decade combined. 
<br />
<br />Now, a roster of well-funded and unprofitable vertical farming companies are preparing to list publicly, including Aerofarms.

&#34;Meat has become a luxury.&#34; thanks to supply chain disruptions, most people are priced out, and &#34;just filling plates with rice or noodles.&#34;

<br />Meat Demand Is Under Threat Like ‘Never Before’ as Prices Surge
<br />A jump in meat prices is forcing families from Brazil to the Philippines to buy less just as a broader move to plant-based eating is gaining traction.
<br />
<br />In the U.S., sales of meat at grocery stores are down by more than 12% from a year ago. In Europe, overall beef demand is predicted to fall 1% this year. And in Argentina, home to one of the world’s most carnivorous populations, per-capita beef consumption has dropped almost 4% from 2020.
<br />
<br />While some of those numbers might seem small, even a tenuous decline is a rarity in the meat world, which until the pandemic hit last year saw years-long growth in consumption to ever-new record highs. Now demand is waning across the globe in what could signal the start of a new broad shift away from animal protein. [IAF: To our prescribed &#34;post-animal economy&#34;]
<br />
<br />The biggest demand deterrent has been a relentless climb for prices that started in October, propelled higher by tightness in global supplies of animal feed and supply-chain disruptions. The United Nations’ global meat price gauge has risen for eight straight months, the longest streak since 2011, and is near a multi-year high. The price shock comes at a time when consumers are still dealing with Covid’s economic fallout, forcing families from Brazil to the Philippines to buy less and swap in other proteins like eggs if they can afford it, or instead just fill their plates with rice or noodles.
<br />
<br />For Eudelia Pena, a 48-year-old who lives in New York City with her husband and one of her three children, meat has become a luxury.

Gives good insight into just how out of control the shipping situation is:
<br />
<br />“We’re hundreds of containers behind where we should be at this point,” he said, with at least 10% fewer products in stock.
<br />
<br />The shipping logjams are due to more than just the backlog in Yantian, which is considered Amazon’s No. 1 Chinese seaport - accounting for 32.4% of shipments handled by the e-commerce company in the three months to May 31, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence’s trade data firm Panjiva.

Kesaya cyberattack closes 500 Swedish Coop supermarkets - another &#34;supply chain attack&#34; (in cybersecurity sense) that affects our supply chain (in real sense):
<br />
<br />__
<br />
<br />Some 500 Coop supermarket stores in Sweden have been forced to close due to an ongoing &#34;colossal&#34; cyber-attack affecting organisations around the world.
<br />
<br />Coop Sweden says it closed more than half of its 800 stores on Friday after point-of-sale tills and self-service checkouts stopped working.
<br />
<br />The supermarket was not itself targeted by hackers - but is one of a growing number of organisations affected by an attack on a large software supplier the company uses indirectly.
<br />
<br />Cyber researchers say about 200 businesses have been hit by this &#34;colossal&#34; ransomware attack, which had mainly affected the US.
<br />
<br />Cyber-security firm Huntress Labs said the hack targeted Florida-based IT company Kaseya before spreading through corporate networks that use its software. The firm believes the Russia-linked REvil ransomware gang was responsible.
<br />
<br />Kaseya said in a statement on its own website that it was investigating a &#34;potential attack&#34;.

A major solar flare measuring X1.5 at its peak erupted on the Sun&#39;s NW limb -- most likely from the newly-formed Active Region 2838 -- on July 3, 2021, producing R3 - Strong radio blackout. The event started at 14:18, peaked at 14:29, and ended at 14:34 UTC. This is the first X-class solar flare of Solar Cycle 25 and the first since September 2017.
<br />
<br />A Type II Radio emission with an estimated velocity of 375 km/s was registered at 14:37 UTC. Type II emissions occur in association with eruptions on the sun and typically indicate a coronal mass ejection is associated with a flare event.
<br />
<br />While this region does not favor Earth-directed coronal mass ejections, the eruption produced R3 - Strong radio blackout -- wide area blackout of HF radio communication, loss of radio contact for about an hour on the sunlit side of Earth.

Sask. crop report says heat baking moisture out of farm country
<br />
<br />The province released the crop report for the week of June 22 on Wednesday and it says the current heat is quickly drying out crop land in Saskatchewan.
<br />
<br />It said that while most of the province received rainfall this week, it was not enough to improve soil moisture conditions or offset the effects of the current heat wave.
<br />
<br />The report stated moisture levels sharply declined this week, with cropland topsoil moisture rating as zero per cent surplus.

Bring in the army: Food group&#39;s call to relieve UK lorry driver crisis
<br />
<br /> Premier Foods (PFD.L), one of Britain&#39;s biggest food companies, has called on the government to consider using the army to distribute goods to help relieve a severe shortage of truck drivers.
<br />
<br />Last week industry leaders warned Britain could face gaps on supermarket shelves this summer and an &#34;unimaginable&#34; collapse of supply chains after the pandemic and Brexit led to a shortage of more than 100,000 heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers.

Malaysia: Vegetables go to waste as farmers wilt under lockdown
<br />
<br />Vegetable farmers at a village here are seeing their precious crops going to waste because of their inability to harvest them during the enhanced movement control order (EMCO) period.
<br />
<br />Farmer Lau Weng Soow from Tringkap said he cannot even go to work on his farm during the EMCO until July 11.
<br />
<br />The village was placed under a two-week total lockdown after health officers detected 70 Covid-19 cases.
<br />
<br />“There is a specific period for us to harvest the vegetables. For example, we need to harvest tomatoes within two and half months after planting them.
<br />
<br />“Since we are under EMCO, we cannot go out to harvest the vegetables. There is no other way but to destroy the vegetables,” he told FMT.

Morano on devolution of current situation into Climate Lockdowns:
<br />
<br />“In order to save the planet from catastrophic climate change, Americans will have to cut their energy use by more than 90 percent and families of four should live in housing no larger than 640 square feet. That’s at least according to a team of European researchers led by University of Leeds sustainability researcher Jefim Vogel. In their new study, “Socio-economic conditions for satisfying human needs at low energy use,” in Global Environmental Change, they calculate that public transportation should account for most travel. Travel should, in any case, be limited to between 3,000 to 10,000 miles per person annually.”

<br />
<br />____
<br />
<br />A “Climate Lockdown,” to extend into perpetuity, reveals the true nature of #COVID1984: normalization of the police state, “climate tracing” and now “climate lockdown” as technocrats shove society towards their post-human future. Their hand is forced as the Global Warming narrative breaks down and the Modern Grand Solar Minimum goes mainstream. In their panic, they are seizing for total control — we are at a demarcation point: we either fight now, or forever lose the opportunity.

Grasshopper infestation becomes sufficiently severe to show up on weather radar:
<br />
<br /> The National Weather Service (NWS) Glasgow says the radar is lighting up, but not with rain.
<br />
<br />Instead, the radar is picking up “countless” grasshoppers in the area according to a post from the NWS.
<br />
<br />The grasshoppers are flying as high as 10,000 feet above the ground and are being picked up by the radar the NWS said.
<br />
<br />Chances of thunderstorms will increase Sunday evening into early next week in the area, but then it will dry out and heat up again according to the post.

BREAKING: Nigeria announces ban on livestock grazing in Southern region. 
<br />
<br />&#34;Banning open grazing in states with long traditions of pastoralism has historically increased poverty and violence, not reduced it.&#34; - @PasturesPolitic
<br />

They are suddenly pushing hard on this idea of &#39;Long COVID.&#39;   A tsunami of disability is coming?  Millions chronically ill?  Couldn&#39;t have been the experimental mRNA shots (whose inventor is warning, but himself being censored)?  No.  Blame the virus that was never isolated.

NYTimes not just fueling race division -- ALSO now making the case for taking farmland from white Georgian farmers to give as reparations:
<br />
<br />&#34;Or maybe she should give some land or money from the sale of it to descendants of the Black people who had helped her family build wealth, either as enslaved people in the 1800s or, later, as sharecroppers who lived in two small shacks on her land.&#34;
<br />
<br />“She is deep in Confederate country trying to do this work,” Mr. Raiford said when he went to visit her farm this spring. If she can figure it out, he said, Chattooga County could be a template for small communities all over the South.

Blackstone makes a &#34;small&#34; $1.4 billion purchase of ESG software provider Sphera -- 
<br />
<br />Blackstone Group Inc said on Tuesday it will buy Sphera, a environmental, social and governance (ESG) software, data and consulting services provider, from private equity firm Genstar Capital in a $1.4 billion deal.
<br />
<br />Chicago, Illinois-based Sphera has more than 3,000 customers and is present in over 100 countries. Its offerings allow organizations to measure and manage their performance and risk exposure pertaining to their ESG activities.
<br />
<br />Blackstone has been trying to strengthen its ESG credentials as investors and lawmakers across the globe increasingly question companies about their environmental and social impact, pushing major global businesses to make significant investments in their ESG initiatives.
<br />
<br />The private equity giant had asked executives in its portfolio companies to report on their ESG matters to their boards for the first time, Reuters reported in early May. read more

Farmers struggle to save crops and animals in scorching weather
<br />
<br />An unprecedented heat wave created challenges for B.C. farmers this week, as chicken farmers desperately tried to cool barns to prevent birds from dying, dairy cows gave less milk and raspberry growers watched their crops wither on the vine.
<br />
<br />&#34;“It’s been extremely stressful,” said Ray Nickel, a Fraser Valley chicken farmer and director with the B.C. Chicken Marketing Board. “There have been losses because of the extreme heat.”

Here is a look into the grocery store of the future -- with Kroger investing.  As I&#39;ve said in past, major changes coming to #retail : the grocery store of the past is dirty and dangerous, so the public will be removed from the supply chain:  enter curbside pickup, and delivery.

&#34;Rolling Shortages&#34; of Food? UK&#39;s Meat Tax &amp; Food Riots
<br />
<br />The UK is now experiencing &#34;rolling brownouts of food supply,&#34; as advisors warn there may be &#34;food riots&#34; in the weeks ahead as food prices escalate to unaffordable levels and shelves are emptied. This is coming soon to the USA and Europe. In the &#34;new normal&#34; of the Great Reset, you will take whatever lab-grown meat is made available to you -- or will you start growing your own food now?

&#34;Researchers admit there are absolutely no current examples of low-energy societies providing a decent living standard for their citizens.&#34;
<br />
<br />To Stop Climate Change Americans Must Cut Energy Use by 90 Percent, Live in 640 Square Feet, and Fly Only Once Every 3 Years, Says Study
<br />
<br />In order to save the planet from catastrophic climate change, Americans will have to cut their energy use by more than 90 percent and families of four should live in housing no larger than 640 square feet. That&#39;s at least according to a team of European researchers led by University of Leeds sustainability researcher Jefim Vogel. In their new study, &#34;Socio-economic conditions for satisfying human needs at low energy use,&#34; in Global Environmental Change, they calculate that public transportation should account for most travel. Travel should, in any case, be limited to between 3,000 to 10,000 miles per person annually.

Coles may be giving butchers &#34;the chop&#34; and &#34;restructuring&#34; their meat department.
<br />
<br />Remember Tesco also recently announced they are getting rid of meat/fish department -- almost like they know they won&#39;t be needed in the future ...
<br />
<br />Major changes coming to #retail ...
<br />
<br />____
<br />
<br />The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union says 1524 Coles meat employees will be affected under the move, which would mean meat would be delivered already cut rather than prepared in-house.
<br />
<br />“They want to get rid of the whole lock, stock and barrel,” the union’s Victorian secretary secretary Paul Conway said.
<br />
<br />“All meat managers, all butchers, all slicers and the others that do packing and stocking shelves.”

Facebook is fact checking Ice Age Farmer videos/links and penalizing those who share them:

<br />- A &#34;fact check&#34; was added to your post indicating that The Great Reset is NOT a secret plan masterminded by global elites (entirely true -- IT&#39;S NOT SECRET AT ALL!)
<br />
<br />- And hey, you can post Ice Age Farmer videos, but no one will see them

Bloomberg amplifying calls to ban all live animals from shipping after container chaos.
<br />
<br />(I do have to say: Totally called this after all the media focus on livestock carried through Suez canal, and New Zealand banning shipping of livestock back in April.)
<br />
<br />Moving into that post-animal economy!  And they even make the appeal to epidemiologists and &#34;dirty, disease ridden animals&#34; ...
<br />
<br />___
<br />
<br />&#34;The Elbeik has become Exhibit A in the mounting case to ban the controversial, $18 billion cross-border trade in live animals. The pandemic has worsened conditions for the roughly 2 billion cows, sheep, goats, pigs and chickens that are exported each year, and epidemiologists have joined the calls for reform. Animals have been stuck in transit far longer than expected and safety inspections have been dramatically curtailed. With new sensitivity to risks that diseased animals can pose to humans, a growing number of countries are limiting or phasing out the practice altogether.

<br />
<br /> Mexico water supply buckles on worsening drought, crops at risk
<br />
<br />Weather forecasts warn of high temperatures portending crop damage and water supply shortages.
<br />
<br />A long-term drought that has hit two-thirds of Mexico is likely to worsen in coming weeks with forecasts of high temperatures and warnings of crop damage and water supply shortages on the horizon, including in the populous capital of Mexico City.
<br />
<br />Experts are sounding the alarm that parched crops could under-produce after temperatures hit 40 degrees Celsius (104F) on June 30 in some parts of northern Mexico, including key farming areas.
<br />
<br />Water shortages are common in parts of Mexico, but have worsened amid heat extremes blamed on climate change, according to scientists and data from Mexico’s federal water commission CONAGUA.
<br />
<br />About 70 percent of Mexico is affected by drought, up from about half in December. About a fifth of the country is experiencing extreme drought compared with less than 5 percent each year since 2012.
<br />
<br />Experts fear the drought will reach the 22 million inhabitants of Mexico City’s metro area, which is quenched by a network of reservoirs. Some districts have no piped drinking water at the best of times.

<br />Jim Mellon predicts the end of animal and dairy farming
<br />
<br />Jim Mellon is a billionaire investor, a businessman, a philanthropist and an author of several prominent books. He also shows the ability to successfully identify emerging global trends.
<br />
<br />To give us a bit of background to his new book and the &#39;New Agrarian Revolution&#39;, Mellon mentions the pandemic. &#34;Where did that pandemic come from? Probably from food malpractice in the Far East. Where will the next pandemic come from? Probably food malpractice in the Far East&#34;. Mitigating future pandemics is one of the reasons he thinks that in the next ten years, &#34;half of the world&#39;s meat will be plant-based&#34; or from &#34;cell-based agriculture where the meat is produced in laboratories&#34;.

More on the &#34;Animals are dirty and dangerous&#34; narrative, invoking the &#39;zoonotic threat&#39; that the UN has long been pushing.
<br />
<br />____
<br />
<br />Zoonotic diseases and agriculture
<br />
<br />&#34;That cow you just gave shots to or cleaning out their pen could be making you sick. Zoonotic diseases are diseases that spread from animals to humans. Many of these germs are part of an animal’s natural flora but cause illnesses in humans. They spread through direct contact with the animal, indirectly by touching surfaces where animals live, through bug bites and even through contaminated food.&#34;
<br />
<br />Knesha Rose-Davison is the communications director for the AgriSafe Network. She says about 50% of the infections that humans get come from animals.
<br />
<br />&#34;The most common would be various forms of influenza that don’t necessarily look the same, but they may present with flu-like symptoms,&#34; she says. &#34;E.coli, salmonella, campylobacter, ringworm. Some are minor in nature if you will, and some can really cause some very life-threatening things like encephalitis.&#34;
<br />
<br />The best way to protect yourself around animals is by washing your hands and drying them with a paper towel, even if you didn’t touch them. Also wear personal protective equipment.
<br />
<br />&#34;Make sure you’re using gloves that can’t be penetrated by different liquids. Even things that we breathe in can cause us infection, so having the proper respiratory protection using a mask that’s NIOSH approved,&#34; she says.

For those who are new, here is my report from exactly a year ago today on the use of &#34;Zoonotic Risk&#34; to separate humans from nature and ultimately herd people out of the countryside into the smart cities.  (This was before Biden was elected, and announced the 30/30 plan)
<br />
<br />THE ZOONOTIC THREAT: Into the Smart Cities With You! The “Biodiversity” Lie &amp; Agenda 2030
<br />
<br />The UN seeks to remove humans from 30% of land and inland water, and considers this “even more important than climate change!” A narrative is being crafted with COVID-19 to justify forcibly moving people off the land and farms, into the smart cities, in the name of “habitat” and “biodiversity.” It may sound reasonable, but what does it REALLY mean? Total control. Christian breaks it down.

Water: Making the Most of It - Growing in the Mega Drought
<br />
<br />As irrigation districts and municipal suppliers cut water allocations in the &#39;mega drought,&#39; we must use strategies to maximize our use of each drop.  In this talk, Christian introduces concepts from rainwater harvesting, greywater systems, sunken beds and earthworks, soil infiltration/holding, creating shade to minimize evaporation, and drought tolerant varieties that will help anyone, anywhere to create a maximum of yield even given a restrictive water budget.

Are we supposed to believe that diplomats are using our food supply as negotiation tit-for-tat? 
<br />
<br />&#34;Fine - I won&#39;t import YOUR seed potatoes!&#34;   as shelves are running empty!
<br />
<br />This is an insultingly poor excuse for absolute demolition of farmers and our food supply -- all to take total control over food production.

<br />UK&#39;s Defra strikes back with ban on EU seed potato imports:
<br />
<br />Defra has blocked large-scale imports of seed potatoes from the EU, matching the ban on British exports that has been in place since the start of the year.
<br />
<br />Up to 10,000t of seed potatoes are imported annually from the EU for planting on British farms, while GB has traditionally exported about 30,000t/year, worth £13.5m, to mainland Europe – mostly high-health stocks from Scotland.
<br />
<br />But, with seed potatoes not included in the post-Brexit trade deal, the trade has been one-way only for the past six months, with Brussels refusing to allow imports from GB into the EU or Northern Ireland.
<br />
<br />NFU Scotland (NFUS) had been critical of the UK government for allowing EU seed imports to continue until the end of June, while its exports are banned.
<br />
<br />The seed potato market is important for Scotland as 75% of the UK’s seed potatoes are grown there and the country is responsible for 80% of UK exports.

Just say the word “megadrought” a few hundred times then take control of the water:
<br />
<br />The water spigots on California farms will soon be twisted tighter.
<br />
<br />As the state faces a growing threat from drought, an increasing number of water agencies are planning to require flow meters on agricultural wells, part of a landmark effort to measure and constrain pumping that used to be free and unlimited. It’s a controversial step aimed at protecting water supplies that could change cultivation practices in the Golden State’s thirsty fields.
<br />
<br />“It’s hard to be as efficient as possible if you don’t know how much water you’re using,” said Sierra Ryan, interim water resources manager for Santa Cruz County.

Biological barcodes and resource tracking is clearly integral part of the blockchain/AI supply chain being rolled out as part of The Great Reset.  But what happens when you eat them?

<br />UK: Free fruit and veg planned for the poor in National Food
<br />
<br />Fruit and vegetables should be prescribed free to deprived families to “break the junk food cycle”, a government-ordered review of eating habits will recommend next week.
<br />
<br />The National Food Strategy will encourage people to eat algae, fermented microbes and other meat alternatives as part of sweeping changes to Britain’s diet to deal with obesity and climate change.
<br />
<br />Henry Dimbleby, the founder of Leon restaurants, will call for fundamental changes from the farm gate to the dinner plate to halt environmental decline and make the country healthier.
<br />Ministers have committed to bring forward proposals within six months of Dimbleby’s recommendations on Thursday, which will attack Britain’s “fatal” food culture.
<br />
<br />Dimbleby will call for changes in agricultural production, marketing and everyday eating and suggest a string of policies to encourage a healthier and more environmentally friendly diet.
<br />
<br />To encourage healthier living, he wants “social prescribing of fruit and veg” similar to the produce prescription programme in the US

District council declares Germany&#39;s first-ever &#39;cyber-catastrophe&#39;
<br />
<br />The #cyberpandemic continues!
<br />
<br />&#39;We are almost completely paralyzed,&#39; says a spokesperson from Anhalt-Bitterfeld municipality in eastern Germany
<br />
<br />A district council in eastern Germany has declared a disaster after its computer systems were paralyzed by a hacker attack in what the federal cybersecurity watchdog confirmed was the country&#39;s first-ever &#34;cyber-catastrophe.&#34;
<br />
<br />Hackers knocked out the IT operations of the municipality of Anhalt-Bitterfeld, in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, on Tuesday, July 6, a spokesperson confirmed to Reuters on Saturday, July 10.
<br />
<br />&#34;We are almost completely paralyzed,&#34; the spokesperson said, adding its offices would probably remain offline next week and giving no indication of when services would resume.
<br />
<br />The municipality declined comment on the identity of the attacker or whether they had made a ransom demand, citing a police investigation. Security sources say German local governments often run outdated and poorly maintained software systems that could be wide open to cyberattack.
<br />
<br />The rural district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld, with a population of 157,000, is for the time being unable to pay out welfare benefits. Its consequent catastrophe declaration is a formal step that allows it to call for federal help.
<br />The cyberattack is the latest in a series of incidents targeting public infrastructure, including the recent takedown of the US Colonial Pipeline, while extortionists have also targeted widely-used IT applications with ransomware attacks.

Facing chronic shortfalls, North Korea tells citizens to start supplying their own food
<br />
<br />North Korea is ordering citizens to start producing their own food to prepare for a long-term food shortage that could last for three years, but ordinary people say that the government is shirking its responsibility, sources in the country told RFA.
<br />
<br />The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in a recent report that North Korea would be short about 860,000 tons of food this year, about two months of normal demand.

<br />UK food supply chain vulnerable to cyber-attack, expert warns
<br />‘Complacent reliance’ on overseas produce and computer ordering has put supply at risk
<br />
<br />Britain’s food supply is highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, a leading food expert has warned, saying greater emphasis on domestic production would boost the UK’s food security.
<br />
<br />“If anyone wanted to really damage the British food system, they could just take out the satellites,” said Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City, University of London. “Our ‘just-in-time’ system is entirely dependent on computerised logistics. When you pay for your food at the checkout, the computer isn’t just adding up the bill, it’s reordering the stock.”

Censorship going to next level because of  &#39;Public Health Crisis&#39; :  fact-checking of text messages.
<br />
<br />____
<br />
<br />&#34;Biden allied groups, including the Democratic National Committee, are also planning to engage fact-checkers more aggressively and work with SMS carriers to dispel misinformation about vaccines that is sent over social media and text messages. The goal is to ensure that people who may have difficulty getting a vaccination because of issues like transportation see those barriers lessened or removed entirely.
<br />
<br />“We are steadfastly committed to keeping politics out of the effort to get every American vaccinated so that we can save lives and help our economy further recover,” White House spokesman Kevin Munoz said. “When we see deliberate efforts to spread misinformation, we view that as an impediment to the country&#39;s public health and will not shy away from calling that out.”

South Africa: food rationing -- Food &amp; fuel shortages after days of rioting, supply chain disruptions in South Africa:
<br />
<br />____
<br />The devastating aftermath of a wash of unrest and looting has resulted in fears of a food and fuel crisis in Durban.
<br />
<br />Motorists and shoppers were seen queuing at petrol stations and grocery stores, flocking to the few places spared by the unrest – and still open for business.
<br />
<br />News24 is tracking active looting sites spread across the city and the suburbs that surround it. At Makro in Springfield Park, a crowd numbering in the thousands has overwhelmed the police.
<br />
<br />Long queues were seen at Spar outlets in Morningside, La Lucia, Umgeni Park, Durban North and Overport, with groceries rationed to prevent panic buying. At Morningside&#39;s Avondale Spar, a Berea resident who asked not to be photographed or named said he queued from 06:00 to 11:00 to get staples for his family.
<br />
<br />He said:
<br />
<br />I was allowed 20 items. I got potatoes, butternut, milk, eggs and stuff like that. It was worth the wait. I don&#39;t know when the shops will open again.
<br />
<br />Fellow resident Cogi Simpson said: &#34;I haven&#39;t got a slice of bread at home. I must wait. Normally I take it for granted that I can walk across the road to the Spar. I am so grateful to the people who stood outside last night looking after us. There were gunshots but the residents were patrolling.&#34;
<br />
<br />Petrol stations – also targeted by rioters – have closed en masse in the city, sparking fears of a fuel shortage. Tankers transporting fuel have been pulled from the roads amid the violence.

The race is on to create Lab-grown fats can make plant-based foods &#34;better than the real thing&#34; -- total reductionist justification:
<br />___
<br />
<br />Fats are an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet — they also add taste, texture and aroma to our foods.
<br />
<br />Animal products naturally contain fats, but with more people looking to plant-based foods, the race is on to create a sustainable fat alternative.
<br />
<br />&#34;We&#39;ve seen a boom in products trying to replace the meat experience,&#34; synthetic biology scientist Ruth Purcell said.
<br />
<br />&#34;We have burgers and sausages and pulled pork that is trying to be meat — but they&#39;re not quite there yet, especially with the taste and quality and function of their cooking abilities.
<br />
<br />&#34;If you&#39;ve ever bitten into a plant-based sausage or burger, it does not taste like meat, and it doesn&#39;t have that juiciness that we all crave and that really good feeling in your mouth.
<br />
<br />&#34;It&#39;s quite dry often and doesn&#39;t cook very well — what&#39;s missing is the fat.&#34;
<br />
<br />Inside laboratories at the Australian National University, the team is genetically manipulating yeast strains and then using the microorganisms to generate fat through fermentation.
<br />
<br />The fats are tailored to taste like beef, chicken, pork, seafood and dairy products.
<br />
<br />&#34;So much of what you might intrinsically think of as animal — cow fat or the animal in general — is actually coming originally from microorganisms,&#34; Ms Purcell said.
<br />
<br />&#34;A lot of these lipids are from the organisms that are naturally inside the cow or the cow&#39;s food, which then go and get taken up by the cow and get stored in its fat.
<br />
<br />&#34;You might think of it as part of the cow, but actually it originally came from a microorganism.

The agenda is deeper than just Zuma. It is well planned. The people steal all the food, ammo etc. everyone removed number plates from vehicles, thus cannot be identified. Then after everything is stolen, the buildings are set to light. Trucks are set to light who bring the food. In March last year the SA President said in a speech- we are joining the NWO. China has infiltrated Africa about 10 years ago. This is all planned

I&#39;m in South Africa, east of Johannesburg, things are tense, went out to stock up on some fuel this evening. This morning I went to the local corner shop and the Police had instructed them to close doors. They waited for the cops to leave and kept on trading with a half door open. I admire our resilience across all of our peace-loving folk who can see through the orchestrated take down of our supply.

CHICAGO, July 12 (Reuters) - An unprecedented heat wave and ongoing drought in the U.S. Pacific Northwest is damaging white wheat coveted by Asian buyers and forcing fruit farm workers to harvest in the middle of the night to salvage crops and avoid deadly heat.
<br />
<br />The extreme weather is another blow to farmers who have struggled with labor shortages and higher transportation costs during the pandemic and may further fuel global food inflation.
<br />
<br />Cordell Kress, who farms in southeastern Idaho, expects his winter white wheat to produce about half as many bushels per acre as it does in a normal year when he begins to harvest next week, and he has already destroyed some of his withered canola and safflower oilseed crops.
<br />
<br />&#34;The general mood among farmers in my area is as dire as I&#39;ve ever seen it,&#34; Kress said. &#34;Something about a drought like this just wears on you. You see your blood, sweat and tears just slowly wither away and die.&#34;

              <div>The vast majority of the American population is completely ignorant about the United States militarized industrial corporate food system that feeds most of the population, and is used to topple governments worldwide. Less than 1% of our population is involved in agriculture today feeding the other 99%+ of our population, and very few people even know this, even in the alternative media. Most Americans have absolutely no clue where their food comes from, and are totally dependent on the commodity-based food system that fills the shelves of America's grocery chains. As a result, Americans spend the lowest percentage of their income on food than any other nation in the world. But the entire nation got a real dose of reality when the COVID Plandemic hit last year, and the meat operations that were dependent on processing plants that require USDA certification to sell their food became a bottleneck that chocked the nation's food supplies.

July 13 (Reuters) - Smithfield Foods, the world&#39;s largest pork processor, has stopped slaughtering pigs in the United States&#39; so-called ham capital, where the company was founded 85 years ago.
<br />
<br />He said there are fewer hogs along the eastern seaboard after farms closed.
<br />
<br />&#34;Taking that plant out probably doesn&#39;t have much of an impact,&#34; Meyer said. &#34;It leaves us snug as a country as far as hog supply verses capacity this fall.&#34;

Britons should eat one-third less meat, and salt and sugar must be taxed, according to a review commissioned by the government, which also recommends subsidies from the taxpayer to promote the development of “alternative proteins”, which could include lab-grown meat.
<br />
<br />The government’s Climate Change Committee has said that Britons must reduce the amount of meat eaten by 20 to 50 per cent by 2050 to become ‘net zero’, which prompted the report’s authors to set the drastic goal of people cutting meat in their diets by 30 per cent “over ten years”.
<br />
<br />There have been rising calls for a meat tax to save the planet in recent years, including from the Green Party’s sole MP, while one British barrister claimed that eating meat was “ecocide” and should be made illegal.

I&#39;m in south africa. In fact i am in durban, Kwazulu-Natal where all this is mainly happening. Currently there are severe food shortages. Almost every shop was looted, and i mean cleaned out. They burnt down whole malls. They burnt down businesses. They destroyed small towns. They destroyed central business districts. You say ahh no one will starve in 3 days. What happens after 3 days when there is still no food? So easy to sit wherewith you are and make uninformed comments. But I live here. My family and friends live here. I see people all over pleading for help. There are no pharmacies either because those too were looted. Thank god for the kindness of the people of this country who have joined forces like never before. Next time you want to comment. Don&#39;t.

Swedish construction faces &#34;crisis situation&#34; as environmental court shuts down cement factory --

<br />The plant produces around three-quarters of all the cement used in Sweden. It is also the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country, responsible for 3% of all CO2 emissions.

Cuba faces food shortage as bakeries run bare. (May 20)
<br />
<br />Soaring international food prices and low domestic production are further squeezing import-dependent Cuba’s ability to feed its people.
<br />
<br />For more than a year, Cubans have formed long lines and braved soaring prices in search of everything from milk, butter, chicken and beans to rice, pasta and cooking oil.
<br />
<br />They have scavenged for scant produce at the market and collected dwindling food rations which closely resemble food rations from World War II.
<br />
<br />In May, the Communist-run government announced flour availability would be cut 30% through July and said the sugar harvest was short more than 30% at less than a million tonnes for the first time in more than a century, threatening domestic consumption.

Yes, they are depopulating - from the article:
<br />
<br />The farm in the Spree-Neisse district had 200 pigs on-site which are all being culled. According to the leading German agricultural title Top Agrar this was an organic pig farm with the possibility for the sows to go outdoors. The virus was detected in a dead pig as part of routine monitoring. So far it is unclear how the virus actually managed to get into the organic farm.

Even shipping issues / collapse of supply chain are now being blamed on unvaccinated sailors - the rhetoric has been turned up to 11:
<br />
<br />- A slow rollout of COVID-19 for seafarers risks worsening a worldwide shipping crisis. 
<br />- Infections on vessels are rising, which could further harm already strained global supply chains. 
<br />- Shipping experts warn of delays and a tightened labor pool leading up to Christmas. 
<br />
<br />&#34;When outbreaks occur on ships it can endanger marine works and cause further disruption to trade.&#34;

<br />
<br />Companies have warned that the country could face meat shortages on items like lamb chops and steaks due to huge quantities of staff being told to self-isolate. Meat processors are seeing up to one in 10 of their workforce told to quarantine by the NHS app.

Farmers in Canada report massive crop damage in heat wave
<br />
<br />In British Columbia fruit has reportedly been cooked on the branch. &#34;It seems like somebody took a blowtorch to it and just singed it,&#34;
<br />
<br />The B.C. Fruit Growers Association reported 50% to 70% of cherry crops were damaged in addition to a lower rate of damage for apples, apricots and other fruits.
<br />
<br />&#34;The overall financial impact is going to be great on the farmers,&#34; Pinder Dhaliwal, president of the organization, said.

Lockdowns are taking their toll on Vietnam -- reports of some localities giving out food tickets to families indicating the two days each week they are allowed to go for groceries.
<br />
<br />During the lockdowns, factories and farms are still allowed to operate but their workers must work, eat, and sleep within the plants and farms and completely isolate from the public and their families.

<br />A COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam is having a marked impact on the country’s seafood industry, with the processing capacity of shrimp and pangasius facility reduced by half and panic-harvesting taking place the country’s Mekong Delta region.

Europe’s Soggy Wheat Means More Will End Up as Animal Feed
<br />
<br />Three weeks of relentless downpours have hurt the harvest quality much more than the size. Now, he thinks just half of his crop is good enough to make the chewy dough used in bakery products, compared with the majority in a normal year. Much of the rest will end up as animal feed, fetching a lower price.

What have they unleashed that is killing songbirds across states, and will it make the leap into poultry?
<br />
<br />____
<br />
<br />Ohio is urging poultry farmers to protect their flocks from a mysterious illness that has sickened and killed songbirds in five area Ohio counties and other states.
<br />
<br />Last week, the Ohio Department of Agriculture and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources encouraged hobby and backyard poultry owners to limit visitors to flocks, wash hands before and after contact with live poultry, and use disposable boot covers or disinfect boots after contact with flocks.
<br />
<br />“Biosecurity refers to everything that owners do to keep diseases away from their flocks. It is an active effort that owners can practice every day,” Summers said.

<br />&#34;The weather also had disastrous consequences for the fruit and vegetable sector. The damage to unprotected soft fruit, cherries and open-field vegetables in is enormous, local sources say. For German open field vegetable farms already battered by the Corona situation, it is becoming increasingly serious as arable land and grassland as well as fruit, vegetable and vineyards are flooded. In many cases, the vegetation was destroyed, otherwise affected by yield and quality losses.

<br />Bill Gates Should Stop Telling Africans What Kind of Agriculture Africans Need
<br />
<br />“We welcome investment in agriculture on our continent, but we seek it in a form that is democratic and responsive to the people at the heart of agriculture, not as a top-down force that ends up concentrating power and profit into the hands of a small number of multinational companies. While describing how GM seeds and other technology would solve hunger in African countries, Bill Gates claimed that “it’s a sovereign decision. No one makes that for them.” But the massive resources of the Gates Foundation, which he co-chairs, have had an outsized influence on African scientists and policymakers, with the result that food systems on our continent are becoming ever more market-oriented and corporate-controlled.

Yakutia, Russia: Russia’s army has sent water-bombing planes to support thousands of firefighters battling huge wildfires in Siberia, a region known for its frozen tundra that is now sweltering under a heatwave. Flames are tearing across over 3000 square miles of forest, and the hardest-hit region of Yakutia in the north has been in a state of emergency for weeks as climate scientists sound the alarm about the potential long-term impact. On Tuesday, more than 2,600 firefighters were battling blazes in Yakutia, which has borne the brunt of the fires in recent years.

Taco Bell out of food (I&#39;m not enjoying living in Idiocracy):
<br />___
<br />
<br />Taco Bell appears to be the latest fast-food joint to get hit by nationwide supply shortages.
<br />
<br />The company, headquartered in California, warned customers that it may be out of certain dishes “Due to national ingredient shortages and delivery delays,” according to a banner message on its website.
<br />
<br />It’s unclear which specific ingredients have run dry or how widespread the issue is — but hangry customers have been taking notice.
<br />
<br />“Taco Bell employee told me there was a ‘national shortage of everything right now,’ and I have decided to get my economic news exclusively from drive-thru employees from now on,” one person wrote on Twitter Monday.
<br />
<br />A user from Michigan said that her Taco Bell was out of chicken and beef, adding, “i just ate black beans in a hard shell. was not worth it.”
<br />
<br />One customer on Reddit wrote that his local eatery “couldn’t make any burritos since they were out of 10″ tortillas, and none of the tacos had lettuce or tomato on them.”

Empty Shelves as promised.  This &#34;pingdemic&#34; is getting out of control...
<br />
<br />Desperate supermarkets hire more staff to beat the pingdemic: Iceland targets 2,000 temps to keep stores open as shelves empty across UK with meat, bottled water and ice cream in short supply
<br />
<br />* Iceland confirmed in the next few days it will start to draft in another 2,000 employees to fill temporary roles
<br />* Sainsbury&#39;s, Tesco, Lidl and Morrisons stores were seen with significant gaps in their shelves this afternoon 
<br />* Comes after the British Meat Processors Association CEO warned about impact on supplies from &#39;pingdemic&#39;
<br />* Issue is exacerbating an existing shortage of delivery drivers caused by Brexit and delays with HGV licenses
<br />* A Food and Drink Federation survey revealed three-quarters of its members reported a driver shortage  
<br />* It comes as a third of Dorset Police&#39;s control room staff were off work after being ordered to self-isolate

A combination of the heatwave, Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic are being blamed for the growing number of empty supermarket shelves across Wales.
<br />
<br />Some shoppers have reported empty shelves in different stores amid warnings about distribution issues, the number of staff having to self-isolate and the heat causing fridges to break down contributing to shortages.
<br />
<br />Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Lidl are just some of the stores that have responded to the complaints from customers.
<br />
<br />There is also a warning that food supply chains are &#34;starting to fail&#34; because of workers isolating over coronavirus contacts.
<br />
<br />The meat industry trade body said it cannot rely on the Prime Minister&#39;s new exemption for some fully vaccinated critical workers because the bar has been set &#34;very, very high&#34;.

Global Wheat Supplies Short as Drought/Flood Ravage Crops &amp; Supply Chain Falters

Engineered attacks on supply chains continue from South Africa to Vietnam.  Food prices are exploding as shortages can no longer be hidden, and the true crisis of global food shortages lies ahead.

SPYING ON YOUR TRASH: AI + Dumpster Cams for the Circular Economy
<br />
<br />It&#39;s true - they are looking through your trash!  Waste Management companies are deploying trucks and dumpsters armed with cameras and AI to monitor your waste. Billionaires like Carlos Slim, George Soros and Bill Gates (plus Blackrock and Vanguard) have ALL invested heavily in these companies to fundamentally transform waste and recycling into the &#34;circular economy&#34; championed by the World Economic Forum. This presages a system like China&#39;s, where throwing away excessive food waste will penalize your social credit score.  In this Ice Age Farmer report, Christian shines a light on this and the myriad other &#34;bars&#34; coming together to form a neo-feudal &#34;prison&#34; system -- even as you sit in the comfort of your home.  It&#39;s time to put an end to this.

China evacuates tens of thousands as storms spread north
<br />
<br />Tens of thousands of people were being evacuated from flood-hit regions of central China on Thursday as officials raised the death toll from heavy rain that has deluged Henan province for almost a week to 33 people.
<br />
<br />More cities were inundated and crops destroyed as the severe weather spread northwards, with the official Xinhua news agency reporting direct economic losses of 1.22 billion yuan ($189 million).

In terms of constantly looking for solutions and building new, local food systems:
<br />
<br />Have you heard of a private membership association (PMA) ?  There is some precedent for NOT incorporating your business (which puts it in the public space, regulated by government), but structuring it as a private association -- out of reach of the state.
<br />
<br />Here&#39;s a good conversation about PMAs specifically for food sovereignty, gets warmed up at 3:00 mark:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3ozszfbCJGI?t=182" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/3ozszfbCJGI?t=182</a>
<br />
<br />That said -- I am also aware of cases where the USDA is actively interfering, such as Miller&#39;s Farm, which is structured as a PMA, having 3,000 lbs of meat detained. I will post their newsletter in the following post.  So, naturally, this is not bulletproof, but we must at least know how to keep our business private.

Miller&#39;s Farm, despite being a private membership association (PMA -- see previous post), has had 3,000 lbs of meat detained by USDA.
<br />
<br />This is economic warfare on our ability to build local food systems to feed our families and communities.
<br />
<br />From the newsletter:  &#34;We are extremely short in processing plants that can turn dairy, meats, and grains into edible foods. So, are farms like our needed or not? ... If USDA continues their mission to intrude in private membership associations and other organizations that supply clean nutrient-dense foods, including small farms, etc., our country could experience a food shortage quicker than one might think.&#34;

Massive flooding in China is set to have a huge impact on the supply chain in the Asian nation, as it affects distribution of everything from cars to coal, according to a report.
<br />
<br />Despite power and the travel infrastructure being restored in the country, the damage which has been caused by several days of downpour is continuing to cause trouble for the production and distribution of goods.
<br />
<br />“As Zhengzhou is a top national transportation hub and Henan province is a major producer of grains, raw materials and some manufactured products like iPhones, we believe the rainfall and flooding will have a material impact on business activity and inflation in the short term,” Nomura analysts wrote, according to Reuters.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau issued a warning on Thursday, saying heavy rain will affect Taipei City and other northern parts of the island through Thursday night.
<br />
<br />The storm is then expected to move on to the Chinese mainland, battering the financial hub of Shanghai and nearby provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangsu with storms and gales, the China Meteorological Administration said.

Read until the end - response to my prior report from Durbin, South Africa:
<br />
<br />__
<br />
<br />A South African here from Durban, the port city of over 5 million at the centre of the looting and destruction.
<br />
<br />I live a middle class lifestyle with a level of material comfort and with amenities that would be familiar to a middle class American or European.  At the societal level this apparent security is marred by inequality, extreme unemployment and poverty and high levels of private debt.
<br />
<br />The looting that took place last week did indeed show clear signs of a degree of planning, instigation and coordination aswell as possible complicity within the security services and police. However the vast majority of looters were indeed a cross section of poor and working class South Africans motivated by genuine frustration and need and responding opportunistically to the lack of police reaction. 
<br />
<br />This was one of the most startling aspects of the ‘riots’: that it felt as though our nation was under a sustained terrorist attack but the weapon used was in fact our own people, our friends and neighbors…ourselves. And here the real point of my comment: looters first attacked liquor outlets, presumably in response to the alcohol trading ban imposed as a covid lockdown regulation. This looting quickly expanded into shopping centre’s generally. In my neighborhood all the major shopping centre’s were completly stripped, some taking the entire day to empty. 80% of stores in the city centre were stripped. 
<br />
<br />Naaivly we belived that with the shops empty things would calm down however (and here I think clear strategic planning is evident) the next targets were the vast wharehousing and production facilities that surround the port. So now the major highway linking the port with the interior was closed due to attacks on trucks, retail outlets were trashed and the factories and wharehouses were being emptied (I saw one which took a full three days to empty with minimal police interference). 
<br />
<br />The supply chain for food and fuel were broken and food security seemed an immediate problem. We heard reports of an increase in farm attacks.
<br />
<br />So this is my point, without pretending to be ignorant of the politics and history that inform the crisis in South Africa, the vulnerabilities of the political and economic systems we essentially share are not unique. Basically overnight my existence and that of the people of our city and province went from the familiar routines of modern industrial society to the reality of supply chain breakdown, social violence and fear and the absolutely real prospect of state collapse. And allthough order has returned we all know it’s not over yet. Friends talk of emigrating but I’m not yet convinced that the traditional escapes of Europe or the US will fare much better if they continue to ignore the social malice of unemployment and poverty and also I think a crisis of agency and meaning amongst the masses of people effectively disenfranchised by this neoliberal disorder. 
<br />
<br />Joe Guy, Durban

American Airlines on Monday urged its pilots to do everything possible to save fuel, warning that a supply crunch in the United States is challenging company operations.
<br />
<br />&#34;Use all available fuel savings strategies when possible,&#34; Managing Director of Flight Operations John Dudley said in a memo to pilots. &#34;Every gallon of jet fuel saved is helpful.&#34;
<br />
<br />Factors behind the supply crunch include shortages of the fuel itself as well as trucks to transport it and drivers, Dudley said.
<br />
<br />&#34;These challenges are not only impacting airports and airlines but also the efforts to fight the large forest fires on the West Coast,&#34; the memo said.

&#34;Sky Has Fallen&#34; - Chinese Farmers Reel After Floodwaters Devastate Pig Herds
<br />
<br />A week later, after heavy rains hammered Henan province in central China, hog farmers in the pork-producing region are reeling over their herds drowning in floodwaters. There&#39;s also a risk of the deadly pig disease African swine fever returning. 
<br />
<br />Small to medium-sized farmers have been severely impacted by floodwaters. 
<br />
<br />&#34;I&#39;m waiting for the water levels to go down to see what to do with the remaining pigs,&#34; said the farmer from Wangfan village, who is located 55 north of Zhengzhou. 
<br />
<br />&#34;They&#39;ve been in the water for a few days now and can&#39;t eat at all. I don&#39;t think even one pig will be left.&#34;
<br />
<br />— 
<br />
<br />To sum up, China may have to continue buying US farm goods due to an already devastating flood season.

              <div>There are few people left alive today that remember the last time a severe drought that destroyed crops combined with a collapse of the financial system left millions of Americans hungry and homeless, back in the 1930s. Most of us alive today were taught in school that in the 1930s the nation suffered during "The Great Depression" as well as "The Dust Bowl." And whether or not these were natural or man-made catastrophes back then is really not all that important when we consider that we are facing such potential dire circumstances for the immediate future, or even worse, here in 2021. Corn and wheat crops in the U.S. are in big trouble right now as we approach the end of July. Prices of corn, soy and canola are all going up right now, due to the fear that this year's harvest will be greatly affected by drought conditions across the U.S. Gloomy outlooks on this year's harvest are not the main reason for concern, however, as we have seen poor weather patterns like this in the past, and few starved or went homeless.…</div>

Brazil is the world&#39;s leading orange juice producer. There are concerns about widespread frost Friday and Saturday in the southernmost regions of south Minas Gerais state could damage citrus trees. 
<br />
<br />Drew Lerner, president of World Weather Inc, told Bloomberg that frost later this week &#34;would damage some trees&#34; in the Minas Gerais state. Below are Friday morning forecast temperatures hovering around freezing. 
<br />
<br />Widespread frost concerns could tighten supplies and is the reason why orange juice futures are up more than 4.50% Tuesday afternoon, hitting levels not seen since December 2018.

South Africa may face bread shortage as riots hit yeast, wheat supplies
<br />
<br />... as &#34;Bread and Circuses&#34; comes to an end - the civil unrest may just be warming up.
<br />__
<br />
<br />A nationwide bread shortage looms as bakeries face a double whammy of critical wheat and yeast supply problems due to rioting and looting in parts of KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.
<br />
<br />Anchor Yeast&#39;s main yeast factory is located in Durban, which supplies bread bakeries across the country.
<br />
<br />Because of closures on the N3, there are problems with getting yeast delivered from Durban to major bakeries in Gauteng, and due to the impact of the riots on operations at Durban harbour, there is difficulty getting imported wheat to millers in KwaZulu-Natal to produce flour.
<br />
<br />Anchor responded on Wednesday that, &#34;as with other manufacturers, we are dealing with an unpredictable situation at present and are not able to provide immediate information. As soon as we are [able to], we will [provide an] update&#34;.
<br />
<br />Fin24 understands that Anchor&#39;s board was set to meet virtually on Wednesday morning. 
<br />
<br />According to a reliable source in the bread baking industry, if the N3 is not made safe soon, the supply of raw materials like yeast from suppliers in KwaZulu-Natal in to major bakeries in Gauteng could lead to bread shortages as early as next week.
<br />
<br />He added that bread baking in KwaZulu-Natal has already come to a halt and there are reports of shops in that province as well as Gauteng already running out of bread due to disruptions in the supply chain or the destruction of shops.

Looming protein shortage boosts spring wheat demand
<br />
<br />Analysts believe protein levels will be well below average by the time the entire crop is off, which means millers will need to blend in some spring wheat. [IAF: ie, yes, the crop in record poor condition in US]
<br />__
<br />
<br />Millers in the United States may be confronted with the double-whammy of a low-protein hard red winter wheat crop combined with severely curtailed spring wheat production, say analysts.
<br />
<br />An estimated 38 percent of the hard red winter wheat crop has been combined. Protein levels have averaged 11.4 percent based on 266 samples, down slightly from the five-year average of 11.6 percent.
<br />
<br />Analysts believe protein levels will be well below average by the time the entire crop is off, which means millers will need to blend in some spring wheat.
<br />
<br />The problem is that U.S. spring wheat production is forecast to be 42 percent below last year’s levels.
<br />
<br />That bodes well for Canadian spring wheat exports to the lucrative U.S. market, said Neil Townsend, chief market analyst with FarmLink Marketing Solutions.
<br />
<br />He thinks the U.S. could easily double its normal purchases of Canadian spring wheat.
<br />
<br />“That’s the most bullish scenario ever. They’re definitely able to pay higher prices,” said Townsend.  [IAF: are you sure?  consumers are being squeezed in all directions]

<br />Two U.S. scientists have won a 1 million euro ($1.18 million) prize for creating a food generator concept that turns plastics into protein.
<br />
<br />The 2021 Future Insight Prize went to Ting Lu, a professor of bioengineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Stephen Techtmann, associate professor of biological sciences at Michigan Technological University, for their project.

Grain shipments cut 25% due to low river levels in Argentina
<br />
<br />BUENOS AIRES, Argentina: The lowest waters in 77 years is reducing the amount of grain being shipped from Argentina&#39;s most import grain hub of Rosario on the Parana River.
<br />
<br />Officials report that ships are having to reduce cargoes by 25 percent due to the low water levels, the head of the local ports chamber said on Friday.
<br />
<br />Officials say there is no relief in sight and the area is expected to remain dry for months.
<br />
<br />The Parana is responsible for carrying some 80 percent of Argentina&#39;s farm exports. Excessively dry weather upriver in Brazil has reduced shipping from the Parana, including soy, wheat and corn crops.
<br />
<br />Argentine officials do not now how the low river will effect wheat exports later this year.
<br />
<br />&#34;Today, ships are loading about 25% less than they do when the river is at normal levels,&#34; Guillermo Wade, manager of Argentina&#39;s Chamber of Port and Maritime Activities, told Reuters.
<br />
<br />&#34;If the situation does not reverse, and nothing suggests that it will, we will be losing 40% of what ships usually carry when water levels are normal,&#34; he added.

Grease shortages expected after the fire at lubrication factory last month -- I&#39;d mentioned this will affect farmers disproportionate to city soyboys, just as we hit harvest season:
<br />
<br />Rockton’s Chemtool plant was once one of the largest manufacturers of grease in the world, but after last month’s fire, there could be a grease shortage for farmers leading up to harvest season. Farmers often use grease to keep certain parts of their equipment operational, but now grease could be the new toilet paper when it comes to a shortage on the shelves.
<br />
<br />“You don’t think much about it, but it’s kind of an important commodity to have access to,” said Illinois Corn Growers Association Executive Director Rodney Weinzierl. “Farmers might have to rely on each other if their combine breaks down.”

<br />Grain imports rise as drought deals severe blow to domestic production
<br />
<br />President López Obrador is determined to achieve food self-sufficiency but imports of key grains actually increased in the first five months of the year as drought ravaged crops in Mexico.
<br />
<br />Imports of a range of grains including corn, wheat and rice increased 13.6% between January and May compared to the same period of last year, according to the secretary general of the National Union of Agricultural Workers (UNTA).
<br />
<br />Drought has also dealt a heavy blow to Mexican farmers. Some 361,000 hectares of crops were damaged by drought in the first five months of the year and approximately 1 million head of cattle died, according to data presented at a forum this week on the drought and its impact on agriculture. The former figure represents a 365% increase compared to the same period of 2020.
<br />
<br />The main crops affected were corn, wheat, rice, beans and sorghum, according to experts who participated in the forum organized by Bayer México.

Corn shortage in Ghana risks &#34;collapse of poultry industry&#34;:
<br />
<br />(bringing in WEF&#39;s post-animal economy:)
<br />
<br />The Greater Accra Poultry Farmers Association (GAFA), fears Ghana’s poultry industry risks collapse if the government fails to swiftly deal with recent challenges of feed for poultry.
<br />
<br />This comes as poultry farmers across the country currently are faced with scarcity and high cost of maize and other ingredients needed for the industry.
<br />
<br />“We do not have the cereals such as maize, soya and the wheat brand available to work. So, we are having intermittent shutdowns and what we see is that there is a looming total shutdown, and we want to avert that because GAFA alone has about 1,775 farmers, and we cannot have a situation where people whose businesses are just poultry farming would have their business collapsing.”

Pundits warn drought blanketing western U.S. to have disastrous result
<br />
<br />The devastating drought blanketing the western United States would not be relieved soon and it could cause more negative impacts to the country&#39;s economy, a group of experts, officials and farmers warned in a virtual meeting.
<br />
<br />According to Wednesday&#39;s report from E&amp;E news, a news organization providing essential energy and environment news for professionals, those participants confirmed that the drought currently covers 96 percent of seven Western states, including Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.
<br />
<br />That means half of the U.S. population lives in a drought-stricken area, the report said.
<br />
<br />... The drought has been particularly hard for Western farmers and ranchers, many of whom are facing water scarcity that is stunting crops and thinning herds as ranchers sell livestock because of feed shortages, Jeff Schafer, a feedlot owner in North Dakota and president of the North Dakota Stockmen&#39;s Association, noted at the meeting.
<br />
<br />He described a landscape of crops in his state that are &#34;boot high instead of armpit high,&#34; pasture grass that &#34;never did turn green,&#34; and cows grazing &#34;on brown grass in June.&#34;
<br />
<br />&#34;We&#39;re seeing 10 percent to 25 percent herd reductions,&#34; Schafer said, noting the effects of a widespread shortage of animal feed.
<br />
<br />North Dakota specializes in durum and hard red spring wheat, and while parts of the state saw rainfall in June, 50 percent of its wheat crop is rated poor or very poor condition, according to a July 13 report from the North Dakota Wheat Commission (NDWC).
<br />
<br />Overall, even though the country&#39;s breadbasket, including Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, and much of Texas still can provide enough food to market, high quality wheat planted in Upper Midwest, such as North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, could have a huge loss.
<br />
<br />Only 16 percent of the U.S. spring wheat crop was rated good to excellent, according to the NDWC&#39;s report.

Brazil feverishly importing after the failure of corn crops.  Brazil is typically one of the world&#39;s largest exporters.
<br />
<br />SAO PAULO, BRAZIL — JBS SA, the world’s largest meat packer, imported 30 shiploads of corn from Argentina into Brazil due to a crop failure in Brazil, Reuters reported, citing a statement it received.
<br />
<br />JBS said purchases from suppliers outside of Brazil represent 25% of the corn it is using as feed, with volumes greater than 1 million tonnes.
<br />
<br />Weather-related problems with Brazil&#39;s second corn crop have led to companies exiting their contracts on washout clauses, threatening exports, Reuters said.
<br />
<br />Brazil&#39;s second corn crop represents between 70% and 75% of all output in a given year and is the country&#39;s biggest corn crop.

Possible corn shortage coming to ND
<br />
<br />BISMARCK, N.D. (KFYR) - Farmers say it’s too late for any kind of rain to save their crops. It’s time to move forward with whatever is in the fields. But what they have has many down the production line worried about what will be available to them.
<br />
<br />If this field represents all of North Dakota’s corn, half of it would go to making ethanol.
<br />
<br />But the drought has cut corn growth across the state, and that has those in the supply chain worried.
<br />
<br />Around the state, it’s a similar picture: dead spots in fields.

<br />Supply-Chain Woes Come to School Cafeterias
<br />Ahead of fall reopening, school districts are shrinking menu options as they face shortages of juice boxes, chicken tenders
<br />
<br />Schools are struggling to secure food for student breakfasts and lunches ahead of classrooms’ planned reopening in the fall.
<br />
<br />Some cafeterias are cutting menu choices as food suppliers face labor shortages and transportation challenges that are adding costs and limiting supplies. Food distributors and school officials say they expect to run low on everything from canned fruit to lunch trays, and some worry that the lack of options will deter students from getting meals at school.
<br />
<br />Across the country, school cafeterias are preparing to welcome back students after running hybrid or remote learning operations for much of the past school year, when they offered prepackaged or to-go food. Many now find themselves at the center of supply-chain woes gripping the broader food industry: Manufacturers are cutting flavors or halting production because of capacity problems, while some distributors dropped deliveries to schools. Some school districts are struggling to hire cooks.
<br />
<br />“We haven’t had a 100% head count school season in 15 months. It’s going to blow the doors open,” said Andy Mercier, chief executive at Merchants Foodservice, a distributor that serves K-12 schools in Alabama and Mississippi.
<br />
<br />Corn dogs, hamburger beef patties and other items that require more hands-on labor are hard to come by [IAF: of course it&#39;s the protein], Mr. Mercier said, because manufacturers are short-handed. A salsa supplier recently told his company that it doesn’t have enough workers to produce sauces for schools. Merchants 
<br />
<br />Foodservice is itself running low on lunch trays as manufacturers give priority to takeout trays for restaurants, he said.

South Africa is NOT &#34;back to normal&#34;.  After the manufactured chaos damaged the supply chain, a cyberattack has closed the ports responsible for importing 60% of the nation&#39;s goods (and more to other inland African countries):
<br />
<br />___
<br />Transnet, South Africa’s state-owned ports and freight-rail company, declared force majeure at the country’s key container terminals after disruptions caused by a cyberattack five days ago.
<br />
<br />The measure covers the Durban, Ngqura, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town harbours because of the effects of the July 22 attack, according to a notice Transnet sent to customers and seen by Bloomberg News. The issues &#34;continue to persist,&#34; it said.
<br />
<br />Force majeure is an unanticipated or uncontrollable event that releases a company from fulfilling contractual obligations.
<br />
<br />“Transnet, including Transnet Port Terminals, experienced an act of cyber-attack, security intrusion and sabotage, which resulted in the disruption of TPT normal processes and functions or the destruction or damage of equipment or information,” it said. “Investigators are currently determining the exact source of the cause of compromise and extent of the ICT data security breach or sabotage.”
<br />
<br />The disruption threatens to have a ripple effect on Africa’s most-industrialised economy, particularly as Transnet’s Durban port handles 60% of the nation’s shipments. The ports are also key to shippers from landlocked African countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Following the #SouthAfrica riots, then cyberattack stopping port activity -- now shipping companies are not even bothering to stop there!
<br />
<br />This is Seige warfare by any other name. 
<br />__
<br />
<br />Ships are starting to bypass SA ports as Transnet tells customers and staff of ‘sabotage’
<br />
<br />Ships have started to bypass South African ports, and many more may now do so, after Transnet delcared force majeure at its port operations on Monday.
<br />
<br />Container vessels that had been due to call at both Cape Town and Durban had been diverted, shipping agents said, in one case to the Port of Maputo, and in other onwards to its Asian stops, bypassing the continent entirely.
<br />
<br />Importers – already struggling with shortages of key goods – will now have longer to wait for containers on those ships. Just how long is not yet clear; a global shipping crisis and shortage of some types of containers already has the industry overall scrambling. Those same troubles have made shipping lines allergic to delays they can not quantify.

Drove past a 35-40 acre alfalfa field a couple days ago that had been cut.  Six (6) small square bales for the whole field. Last week I saw a similar sized field with only four (4) bales.  Prices have gone from around $105/ton to over $400.

Philippines: the unvaccinated are now locked down in their homes, by order of President Duterte:
<br />
<br />Duterte ordered village chiefs to prevent those in their communities who refuse to be vaccinated from leaving home.
<br />
<br />“I am telling you, don’t leave your homes. If you go out, I will tell the police to escort you back to your house because you are a walking spreader,” Duterte said. “If you don’t want to help the country by getting vaccinated, then better stay in your homes.”

Canada border officers vote to strike, warn of #SupplyChain disruption
<br />
<br />The impacts could bring delays to commercial vehicle traffic and impact parcel deliveries and duties collection, the union said. 
<br />
<br />The Port of Vancouver appears particularly vulnerable as it contends with an unprecedented level of container ship traffic. As the largest port in Canada, any disruption there could have impacts throughout the country and intermodal rail and trucking operations.

Wow -- Google/Facebook mandate vaccine for all employees.  Think about what this means -- there will be no one at the company who minds censoring &#34;those crazy anti-vaxxers!&#34;  They created and now are enforcing ideological echo chambers within big tech.  And within government.  
<br />
<br />This has implications far beyond just employee vax mandates -- the entire apparatus will be staffed by state worshippers and enforcers of medical tyranny.

Yesterday I shared a meme &#34;Vax macht frei.&#34;  Some found it tasteless, but I thought it portrayed well the false promise -- and the absolute insanity right now. 
<br />
<br />What I didn&#39;t know was that this actually happened in Germany, where the swastika remains an forbidden symbol.
<br />
<br />Impfen = Freiheit (Vaccines = Freedom) was displayed on the tower in Düsseldorf, NRW.
<br />
<br />Presented without comment - I think this speaks for itself.

Dubai launching police drones to &#34;help response times.&#34;
<br />
<br />Besides ground-based security cameras using facial recognition technology to identify faces, drones will also employ the nanny state technology. This will ensure police can identify criminals and drug dealers. 
<br />
<br />... and say goodbye to civil liberties because there are no civil liberties in Dubai as the use of surveillance tech on citizens is widespread.

Vegans exempt from compulsory Covid vaccinations, legal experts warn
<br />
<br />Suddenly I identify as trans-vegan.  
<br />
<br />#WarOnMeat 
<br />
<br />____
<br />
<br />Vegans would be exempt from compulsory workplace Covid vaccinations and employers risk legal action if they insist workers are double-jabbed, &#34;experts&#34; say.
<br />
<br />The Covid vaccine does not contain animal products, but all medications currently go through animal testing.
<br />
<br />Ethical veganism was ruled to be a protected characteristic at a tribunal last year.
<br />
<br />It means any employers would risk legal action if they order staff to be vaccinated.
<br />
<br />A spokesman for Lewis Silkin, a law firm, told the Telegraph: “Some ethical vegans may disagree with vaccinations on the basis that they will inevitably have been tested on animals.
<br />
<br />“Ethical veganism has previously been found to amount to a belief, capable of being protected.”
<br />
<br />The protections mean that vegans and people in other categories, including some religious groups as well as those with certain disabilities or medical conditions, could mount a claim of constructive dismissal if forced to get the jab.
<br />
<br />“The definition of veganism recognises that it is not always possible or practicable for vegans to avoid participating in animal use, which is particularly relevant to medical situations.
<br />
<br />“In the case of Covid-19, vaccination will play a fundamental role in tackling the pandemic and saving lives. As there is currently a legal requirement that all vaccines are tested on animals, at this point in time it is impossible to have a vaccine that has been created without animal use.”

African Swine Fever has reached the Dominican Republic - threatening US hog industry
<br />
<br />This is a timebomb.  Recall that USDA has done drills about ASF reaching (and ending much of) US hog farming.  
<br />
<br />__
<br />
<br />African Swine Fever has reached the American region through the Dominican Republic. So far, local authorities and USDA experts are investigating 389 suspicious samples, of which 273 have been confirmed and transmitted to OIE as ASF outbreaks. [IAF: 273 suddenly all at once??]
<br />
<br />The outbreak has occurred in an area located between the Sánchez Ramírez and Montecristi provinces, and it is considered that it may affect, in the absence of appropriate analyzes, 842 animals, including farm animals and those raised by families in the backyard. In total, these provinces have 15,000 and 4,600 pigs, respectively. The country&#39;s pig herd does not exceed two million pigs.
<br />
<br />Despite the fact that the Dominican Republic is not an important player in the region&#39;s pork market, this is a signal of alert for other countries such as Brazil, the US and Canada which are well-positioned in the international market.

This &#34;risk map&#34; was created by insurance company Munich Re.

<br />Seismic and meteorologic hazards listed below for any given area are expected to increase during a #GrandSolarMinimum. Generally, risks can be expected to be amplified, plus a long term overall cooling as growing regions move towards the equator. (This doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t be hot - remember, temperature and precipitative extremes means drought/flood, hot/cold).

Repeated uncharacteristically cold temperatures in Brazil&#39;s growing regions:
<br />
<br />SAO PAULO, BRAZIL — Freezing temperatures this week in Brazil could hurt corn and wheat in the nation’s southern and southeastern states, Reuters reported, citing Conab, the government’s food supply and statistics agency.
<br />
<br />There is risk of moderate and severe frosts in Sao Paulo and Parana states, which could affect second corn that is in the grain-filling stage as well as wheat that is in the flowering stage.
<br />
<br />Corn and wheat in Mato Grosso do Sul could also be hit by frosts, though in fewer areas, Conab said.
<br />
<br />Conab predicts crop failure due to water stress followed by frosts in three states in relation to second corn, Reuters said.
<br />
<br />A production drop is also expected for wheat due to drought in Goiás and frosts in Mato Grosso do Sul, São Paulo and western fields in Paraná.

China Floods, Brazil Freezes, US Dry - Top Exporters Lose Crops as Grains Crisis Accelerates
<br />
<br />As Brazil gets hit repeatedly by unusually low temperatures, destroying crops, the flooding in China, including Henan province -- which accounts for 10% of their grains production -- has damaged wheat, infrastructure, and thousands of large hog farms. All hopes are on US, which is also having its own issues.  This signals a huge red flag for worldwide production as these are the #1/2/3 producers/exporters of many grains. In fact, Brazil has started importing! Christian explores what this means in this episode of the Ice Age Farmer broadcast.
