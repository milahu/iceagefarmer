Feds cut water to California farmers!
<br />
<br />CVP made targeted cuts to agricultural users, eliminating their supply of surface water for the foreseeable future. “Technically speaking, USBR is calling the cuts a &#34;freeze&#34; of the 5% allocation, meaning no water will be delivered until the agency knows what it can deliver.”
<br />
<br />The decision by Reclamation puts farmers already preirrigating and planning for spring crops in a bad situation. Los Banos area farmer Joe DelBosque said he will be forced to give up on 105 acres of asparagus and perhaps some other crops as the water he relies upon to irrigate can come only from surface sources. He has no well water to augment these losses.
<br />
<br />&#34;I&#39;ve already planted sweet corn and 200 acres of melons are in the greenhouse ready for planting,&#34; he said.

Many people have asked for more about the &#34;Absolute Zero&#34; timeline.  I&#39;ll be doing a follow up report about this, but take a look at these swim lanes:
<br />
<br />- Road vehicles:  60% of use by 2050 (Biden/DoT just announced tax on VMT - Vehicle Miles Traveled - to start this)
<br />- Rail: becomes the alternative
<br />- Flying:  all airports CLOSE.
<br />- Shipping:  all sea shipping CEASES (west coast port blockages &amp; suez canal start this discussion)
<br />- Heating:  electric heat replaces wood burning stoves
<br />- Appliances:  gas cookers replaced by electric
<br />- Food:  meat phased out 50% by 2030, 100% by 2050 ( #WarOnMeat )
<br />- Materials: steel recycling grows, plastics decrease (current plastic resin shortage sets stage)
<br />
<br />Apparently China isn&#39;t on this plan, as they build coal power plants and build &#34;Belt &amp; Road Initiative&#34; . . .

Hugely expensive problems and supply chain issues for food companies:
<br />
<br />B&amp;G Foods, Inc. (BGS - Free Report) is troubled by escalated SG&amp;A expenses. Additionally, high costs associated with COVID-19 as well as input cost inflation are key concerns for the company. Apart from these, the company is encountering supply-chain-related headwinds.
<br />
<br />Hurdles in B&amp;G Foods’ Way
<br />B&amp;G Foods encountered major supply-chain capacity hurdles in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020 and was unable to fully cater to the rising demand for brands offering meal solutions such as Ortega and Bear Creek. Also, spices &amp; seasoning sales were hurt by production capacity constraints, packaging outages and absenteeism due to pandemic-led quarantine.
<br />
<br />Talking of costs, the company’s SG&amp;A expenses have been rising year over year for quite some time now. The metric increased 31.5% to $58.5 million in the fourth quarter, thanks to the rise in consumer marketing costs, acquisition/divestiture-induced and non-recurring expenses, warehousing costs, selling expenses as well as general and administrative expenses. Additionally, the company continued to incur high costs associated with COVID-19 at its manufacturing facilities, which came in at roughly $4.3 million during the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2020, the company saw nearly $13.5 million as additional COVID-19 costs at its manufacturing facilities, mainly including temporary better compensation for manufacturing workers, compensation to manufacturing workers during their quarantine and costs associated with other precautionary health and safety methods.

Amsterdam muni water supply at risk of hack:
<br />
<br />Waternet will be subject to stricter supervision by the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT). The water company, which is responsible for water management in Amsterdam and the surrounding area, does not have its digital security in order. This has emerged from research by the ILT.
<br />
<br />Due to the shortcomings at Waternet, there is an increased risk of a digital incident, such as a hack, with possible consequences for the quality and supply of drinking water. According to the inspectorate, there are no indications that there is already an acute danger.
<br />
<br />The fact that digital security is not good enough is partly due to the fact that Waternet does not yet have a procedure for reporting IT breaches that could have major consequences for the drinking water supply. As a result, it may take longer for incidents to be resolved and the consequences of incidents may increase unnecessarily.
<br />
<br />The inspectorate conducted the investigation at Waternet from November 24, 2020 to February 5, 2021, after research platform Follow the Money wrote in September 2020 that Waternet&#39;s cybersecurity is &#34;as leaky as a basket&#34;. Discussions with various internal sources and documents revealed that computers and systems were outdated and that access to the network was poorly secured.
<br />
<br />The stricter supervision will last until the digital security of the drinking water company has improved sufficiently.

It’s happened - China (despite all studies saying it’s not an issue) invokes the WEF narrative that frozen food is COVID superspreader, uses these faulty PCR tests on frozen meat packaging to find “positive result” and BANS US POULTRY IMPORTS FOR ONE WEEK from that supplier.

In spring of 2020, America’s Heartland had just begun trying to forget Bomb Cyclone Ulmer’s cataclysmic insults of mid-March 2019. During that weather trauma, millions of acres of low-lying cropland were practically erased. Flooding destroyed mega-tonnages of stored corn and soybeans. Flood vulnerable grain bins had their contents contaminated. In reponse, countless trailer-loads of large hay bales were donated by growers outside Ulmer’s battle zone, to help flood-ravaged producers feed their hungry livestock. The total net loss to America’s 2019 grain reserves will probably never be known.

<br />LAB-GROWN, CELL-CULTURED COCOA FROM BIO-REACTOR:  Chocolate to hit shelves in 2-years:
<br />
<br />At the ZHAW in Wädenswil, researchers have succeeded for the first time in multiplying cocoa cell cultures and making chocolate from them. It should have an intense aroma and be available in stores in two years.
<br />
<br />However, chocolate from the laboratory has the advantage that it can avoid problems with conventional chocolate production such as overuse of the soil and exploitative working conditions. (cue the calls for race-equitable food system)

French Oil Giant Backs Startup Recycling CO₂ Into Animal Food
<br />
<br />Deep Branch raised 8 million euros to build a pilot plant to turn carbon dioxide into feed for livestock.  [IAF: this is ZERO-emissions feed]
<br />
<br />U.K. startup Deep Branch secured funds from backers including French oil giant Total SE for its plan to turn carbon dioxide emissions into food for chickens, fish and pigs. 
<br />
<br />The company uses a fermentation process similar to winemaking or pickling, except that microbes feed on CO₂ and hydrogen instead of sugars. The result is a 70% protein product called Proton that can replace conventional livestock feed such as fishmeal and soybeans. The agriculture industry’s reliance on the two ingredients has been linked to the depletion of wild fish stocks and caused large-scale deforestation.

Alaska could challenge all-time April temperature records as potentially historic cold blast from the Arctic Ocean heads south this week
<br />
<br />The state of Alaska is experiencing an unusually cold Arctic blast this week, with temperatures forecast to reach close to -50 °F in some areas this weekend. Therefore challenging its 100+ years old all-time temperature records with this extremely cold air mass arriving from the Arctic Ocean. The cold pool could then turn towards the Contiguous United States next week, resulting in very cold mid-April.

Stunning reports coming in from Spring frosts last week across Europe -- no Slevinian fruit this year!
<br />
<br />The sub-zero temperatures hitting last week could result in EUR 40-50 million in damage caused to fruit and wine growers, Agriculture Minister Jože Podgoršek said on Monday as he continued visiting the frost-stricken areas. 
<br />
<br />The minister said it was still too early for the final estimate of the damage, but noted there will be practically no Slovenian fruit this year.

The frost that covered a large part of France this week is shaping up to be one of the worst in decades, with many crops, especially vineyards and orchards, having been hit from north to south of the country.
<br />
<br />The agricultural disaster regime, triggered on Friday by the government, compensates for crop losses and losses of funds caused by abnormal variations in the intensity of a natural climatic agent (drought, flood, frost ...).

France declares disaster:
<br />
<br />The French government is to declare an agricultural disaster over an unusual early spring frost that has damaged crops and vines across the country, the agriculture minister said.
<br />
<br />Julien Denormandie told Franceinfo radio late Thursday that the cold snap had been &#34;particularly difficult&#34; for the sector with &#34;significant losses&#34; registered.
<br />
<br />He said the situation was &#34;quite exceptional&#34;, with vineyards hit but also other crops like beet and rapeseed in regions spanning the north of the country to the southeast.
<br />
<br />In a bid to ward off the frost, French winemakers have lit thousands of small fires which have caused a layer of smog in the southeast of the country.

Restaurants across the U.S. are finding it tough to find single-serve ketchup, from mom-and-pop places to big chains like Long John Silver’s, according to the Wall Street Journal. The price of packets has gone up 13%, and their share relative to bottles has “exploded,” the Journal says.
<br />
<br />The demand for takeout during the pandemic has made single-serve packets the only viable packaging for ketchup in many places. Even with sit-down service, some local laws forbid traditional glass bottles on tables for sanitary reasons.
<br />
<br />Kraft Heinz will open two new lines this month, and more later, to with a goal of increasing production by 25%. Nonetheless, some hardcore Heinz ketchup fans, both restaurateurs and consumers, are turning to alternatives out of necessity.

              <div>A planned famine is being implemented world wide. Along with many other agendas, the intentional destruction of the food supply has been a part of the COVID program we are all being subjected to. 

In this episode we have Christian Westbrook of http://www.IceAgeFarmer.com speaking about the current state of the engineered food system collapse, and then I'll have Marjory Wildcraft of http://www.TheGrowNetwork.com speaking about how you can ensure your own food supply in your backyard. 

All of the worlds wealthiest people have their own farms and food supply and it is extremely urgent that you start doing this today.

Robots are an increasingly common sight in stores, helping customers carry their shopping, keeping track of stock and mapping the layout. Now they’re getting a bit more hands-on thanks to Japanese company Telexistence, which has begun trials in convenience stores of a robot shelf-stacker that can be controlled by a human via VR.
<br />
<br />The Model T (yes, it’s named after the classic Ford car) looks like the most mundane Gundam ever. It’s basically a robot torso mounted to a waist-high platform, restocking shelves in a store with its two articulating arms and complex hands.

Grain export restrictions embarked on by Russia and Kazakhstan during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic brought a hiatus upon the food supply chain in several countries in 2020. A big question now is whether 2021 will be any better.
<br />
<br />The Kazakh export restrictions had the potential to doom the country’s neighbors to starvation, local market participants claimed in March 2020. Now, almost a year into the pandemic, the fears over food security in some countries keep mounting since new export restrictions continue to drive prices up.
<br />
<br />In Turkmenistan, the 2020 harvesting campaign turned out to be extremely tense, as the government had to deploy law enforcement to grain harvests to prevent farmers from hiding grain, according to the Vienna-based Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights (TIHR).
<br />
<br />“Right before the beginning of the harvesting campaign, the regional authorities, police, and tax office have been visiting farms running their own mills to shut them down so that all grain ended up in the state warehouses,” said TIHR spokesperson Farid Tukhbatulin.
<br />
<br />Struggling against the grain shortage, the government also ordered state-owned farms to increase grain production compared to the previous year. The targets set by the government in most cases were unrealistic, local farmers claimed.

Dutch supermarkets run out of cheese after ransomware attack
<br />
<br />(IAF: Much like the &#34;Americold&#34; attack - they had no idea what inventory was where:)
<br />
<br />A ransomware attack against conditioned warehousing and transportation provider Bakker Logistiek has caused a cheese shortage in Dutch supermarkets.
<br />
<br />Bakker Logistiek is one of the largest logistics services providers in the Netherlands, offering air-conditioned warehousing and food transportation for Dutch supermarkets.
<br />
<br />Last week, Bakker Logistiek suffered a ransomware attack that encrypted devices on their network and disrupted food transportation and fulfillment operations.
<br />
<br />&#34;We could no longer receive orders from customers,&#34; Bakker director Toon Verhoeven told NOS. &#34;And in our warehouses we no longer knew where products were. These are very large warehouses, you don&#39;t just go looking for a pallet. We also couldn&#39;t plan our transports anymore. We have hundreds of trucks, which was not done by hand either.&#34;
<br />
<br />This disruption led to a shortage of certain food products, especially cheese, at the Netherland&#39;s largest supermarket chain, Albert Heijn.

In the latest blow to global food production, Taiwan is diverting water from rice farms to semiconductor factories to keep the iPhones &amp; car chips flowing.  &#34;The Taiwanese public appears to have decided that rice farming is less important, both for the island and the world, than semiconductors.&#34;  Only a system run by technocrats could value global cellphone production over local food security.  Christian from the Ice Age Farmer broadcast breaks it down.

Another track worth researching is the merger of IoT with newly COVID-revitalized healthcare totalitarianism:  IoT (Internet of Things) becomes IoB (Internet of Bodies):  
<br />
<br />[IAF: note that a silicon valley company is testing their tech in Shanghai]
<br />
<br />from the World Economic Forum:
<br />
<br />We’re entering the era of the “Internet of Bodies”: collecting our physical data via a range of devices that can be implanted, swallowed or worn.
<br />The result is a huge amount of health-related data that could improve human wellbeing around the world, and prove crucial in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
<br />In the special wards of Shanghai’s Public Health Clinical Center, nurses use smart thermometers to check the temperatures of COVID-19 patients. Each person’s temperature is recorded with a sensor, reducing the risk of infection through contact, and the data is sent to an observation dashboard. An abnormal result triggers an alert to medical staff, who can then intervene promptly. The gathered data also allows medics to analyse trends over time.
<br />
<br />The smart thermometers are designed by VivaLNK, a Silicon-Valley based startup, and are a powerful example of the many digital products and services that are revolutionizing healthcare. After the Internet of Things, which transformed the way we live, travel and work by connecting everyday objects to the Internet, it’s now time for the Internet of Bodies. This means collecting our physical data via devices that can be implanted, swallowed or simply worn, generating huge amounts of health-related information.
<br />
<br />Some of these solutions, such as fitness trackers, are an extension of the Internet of Things. But because the Internet of Bodies centres on the human body and health, it also raises its own specific set of opportunities and challenges, from privacy issues to legal and ethical questions.

&#34;In 2017, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration approved the first use of digital pills in the United States. Digital pills contain tiny, ingestible sensors, as well as medicine. Once swallowed, the sensor is activated in the patient’s stomach and transmits data to their smartphone or other devices.&#34;

Supply chain problems impacting inputs, parts
<br />
<br />A market analyst says everyone including farmers is having difficulty getting needed products. Mike North with ever.ag says, “The supply chain right now is being stressed at a level that we’ve never experienced in our lifetimes.”
<br />North tells Brownfield the difficulty with getting some crop inputs is forcing some farmers to change crop rotations. “Not because I don’t want to, not because the ground is not ready for it, but I just simply can’t get my hands on the right things to grow a crop so I’m going to shift to something else.

A number of major news organizations worldwide, ranging from Scientific American and The Columbia Journalism Review to The Guardian and Al Jazeera, have signed a pledge to begin referring to “climate change” as a “climate emergency” in their reporting.

“Scientific American has agreed with major news outlets worldwide to start using the term ‘climate emergency’ in its coverage of climate change,” the publication announced Monday in a tweet to its 3.9 million followers touting “the impact we hope it can have throughout the media landscape.”

“We Are Living in a Climate Emergency, and We’re Going to Say So,” the headline of a Scientific American commentary published Monday declares. Claiming that that climate change is “the biggest environmental emergency to beset the earth in millennia,” the piece announces the name change:


“Given the circumstances, Scientific American has agreed with major news outlets worldwide to start using the term ‘climate emergency’ in its coverage of climate change.”

CowCredits:  selling indulgences for your livestock carbon footprint.
<br />
<br />A British-Swiss firm behind cattle food which reduces a cow&#39;s methane emissions by 30% has begun selling carbon credits to allow companies to offset their CO2 footprint.
<br />
<br />Mootral has developed the special feed at their laboratories in Abertillery in the Welsh Valleys.
<br />
<br />It works by using an extract of garlic in a special formulated food supplement for cattle, which removes micro-organisms in a cow&#39;s stomach that create methane.
<br />
<br />Now the firm wants companies and individuals to offset their carbon footprint by purchasing so-called &#34;CowCredits&#34; for around £60 - equivalent to one tonne of CO2.
<br />
<br />The credits are similar to other carbon offsetting schemes which see trees planted but instead involves the purchase of cattle feed which can reduce methane output.

Ok - the data is coming in for Brazil&#39;s safrinha crop (the crop of corn they sneak in after beans are harvested).  As we&#39;ve covered here in depth, the soybeans were very delayed, and the safrinha missed the planting window.  Now we&#39;re getting a sense of the damage, and it&#39;s massive.

Normally overwhelming, the Mahendratanaya river, flowing through Gajapati district and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh in India, is now completely dry… A severe drinking water and farming crisis is quickly sweeping across the region…
<br />
<br />Water shortage has resulted in acute crisis for the farming sector, with thousands of hectares of vegetables devastated…
<br />
<br />The river disappearance worsens the already critical drinking water crisis in the region.
<br />
<br />There is so little water that the company responsible for drinking water supply had to dredge the river bed to channelise water to the mouth of the suction pipes.

With climate change, environmental breakdown, and pandemics wreaking havoc on food systems over the coming years, the &#34;silver bullet&#34; solutions offered by the new agri-food giants may prove irresistible to panicking policymakers. This year&#39;s UN Food Systems Summit—arising from a partnership between the UN and the World Economic Forum—will be a showcase for corporate-led &#34;solutions.&#34;
<br />In other words, the keys of the food system are already being handed over to data platforms, e-commerce giants, and private equity firms. This could mean dismantling the diversified food webs that sustain 70% of the world&#39;s population and provide environmental resilience. It could mean putting the food security of billions of people at the mercy of high-risk AI-controlled farming systems and opaque supply corridors.

The US is facing a supply-chain crisis as 21 cargo ships float off the coast of LA waiting to dock
<br />
<br />A supply-chain crisis is quietly brewing off the coast of Southern California as massive freighters wait for dock space to open up.
<br />
<br />California ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach account for about one-third of US imports. These ports operate as a primary source of imports from China and have been heavily congested for months.
<br />
<br />On Wednesday, 21 ships were anchored off the coast waiting for a spot to open up to unload at Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, according to data from the Marine Exchange of Southern California.

Increasingly Worried Dryness Will Clip Brazil&#39;s Safrinha Corn Crop
<br />
<br />Rainfall was limited over the past week for Brazil’s Center-South, while temperatures were high, increasing concern about the region’s safrinha corn crop, especially in Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná and São Paulo, reports the ag consultancy AgRural. These states have been dealing with dry conditions since late-March. Goias and Minas Gerais were also dry last week, raising some cautionary flags. The best rains have been falling in Mato Grosso, but even there rains have been increasingly irregular with low humidity a concern, the consultancy reports.

CYBERWAR is imminent &amp; will affect ordinary Americans, claims CEO of company that ‘discovered’ SolarWinds hack (3/1/21)
<br />
<br />Cybersecurity firm FireEye has warned Americans that they’ll be targeted by the next big cyberattack, whether they know it or not. Disrupted supply chains and the chaos of cellular and internet networks crashing will follow.
<br />
<br />“The next conflict where the gloves come off in cyber, the American citizen will be dragged into it, whether they want to be or not. Period,” FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia told Axios on HBO on Sunday.
<br />
<br />“People don’t even know all the things they depend on. All of a sudden the supply chain starts getting disrupted because computers don’t work,” he continued, threatening viewers with his description of a rapid, uncontrollable descent into chaos.

TOKYO -- Not a day goes by without Taiwan in the news. U.S. military leaders warn of the possibility of a Taiwan Strait contingency. U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga underscored the importance of peace and stability across the strait during their meeting Friday.
<br />
<br />But what exactly are we to expect if such a Taiwan crisis were to occur? How would Japan&#39;s economy and society be impacted?
<br />
<br />One scenario is that commercial ships would be unable to freely sail the East China Sea and South China Sea, due to American and Chinese warships facing off in the waters. What will happen if this continues for, say, six months? The supply chain for essentials including fuel and food will be disrupted, and the Japanese economy faces chaos.

Clock’s running out on climate change. California says it’s time for giant carbon vacuums
<br />
<br />Pipelines need to be built, vast geological reservoirs deep underground need to be fashioned into carbon dioxide storage facilities, costly new technologies for vacuuming carbon from the air and factories need to be brought up to scale.
<br />
<br />“We need to see some pilot projects and test them out as soon as possible,” said Rajinder Sahota, deputy executive officer for Climate Change and Research at the California Air Resources Board. “All of the modeling we have says if we don’t start investing in a significant amount of this in this decade, we will not be set up to reach California’s goal of carbon neutrality by mid-century.”

France - Spring frost to cost wine industry €2bn
<br />
<br />The freezing temperatures were problematic for vines because early-Spring warmth had accelerated the growing cycle, leaving early-budding grapes susceptible to the frost, as the sub-zero conditions damage any early green growth, beneath which are the embryonic flower clusters – the source of the year’s crop.
<br />
<br />Northern Rhône producer, Jean-Michel Gérin said he’d lost almost 90% of his crop, representing a reduction of 70,000 bottles of wine.

Nevada is looking into “water banking,” which, in short, is the creation of a market to sell and/or buy water rights. [IAF: so the people who print money can buy up all the water rights] The Nevada legislature is looking at whether this “water banking” would be a better way to manage water rights than current water law.  We are all familiar with water law dating back to the early 1900s – water rights are attached to the land, period.  
<br />
<br />“I have written extensively about adapting to changes in production agriculture, the meat industry, and the food industry.  However, I will say, without exception, that this idea to create a market to trade water rights is absolutely one of, if not the, worst proposals that could have ever been put on paper.”

<br />The Canadian Grain Commission (CGC) has suspended their license as of yesterday, 4/20. They are prohibited from selling stocks in store, accepting producer deliveries, and contracting new grain sales.
<br />
<br />Reason why is not stated explicitly, but CGC implies insufficient capital to continue operating:  “I can’t get into that, only to say at this point we want to give them a chance to manage their finances and they have nine days to do so,” Gosselin said. “April 30 we will decide if their licenses are reinstated or revoked.  There is justifiable cause for us to take the actions we did,” he said. “We need to have assurance that they will be able to meet their assurances of licensing beyond April 30. I’ll just leave it at that.”
<br />
<br />I was contacted by folks within WA to say something is very wrong with the way operations are being halted — they are unable to speak further as the audit is still in progress.
<br />
<br />Keep an eye on this — why is #Canada pulling licenses from grain companies, and shutting them down?

Similarly, Alberta has suddenly pulled funding from a plant protein alliance — which I&#39;d expect them to be funding heavily as part of the War On Meat:
<br />
<br />What&#39;s going on in Canada?
<br />
<br />&#34;Today we sadly share the news that PPAA is shutting down.
<br />
<br />We did not receive renewed funding from the provincial government for the current fiscal year and without it we simply do not have the money to continue.
<br />
<br />To clarify some confusion out there, the government initially confirmed in early March we would receive funding for another year, but then March 31 told us they had reversed their decision and PPAA would not get further money.&#34;

“Inhaled” viral therapeutic hailed as a solution for anti-vax — toss some mRNA in chemtrails, done and done:
<br />
<br />“Rather than delivering the Cas13a protein itself to the lungs, the CRISPR system works by supplying a messenger RNA (mRNA) with the instructions to make the anti-viral Cas13a protein. This is the same idea as the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which temporarily direct your muscle cells to produce viral spike proteins that launch an immune response. In this case, the lung cells translate the Cas13a mRNA to produce the protein. Directed by the guide RNA that was also delivered to the same cells, Cas13a degrades the viral RNA and stops the infection. Because mRNA doesn’t enter the cell’s nucleus, it doesn’t interact with DNA and raise potential concerns about causing unwanted genetic changes. [in theory...]

MALAYSIA:  Higher animal feed cost due to the global rise in the price of soya and corn meal “is beyond our control”, agriculture and food industries minister, Ronald Kiandee said today.
<br />
<br />He said prices have risen since four months ago and the reality is that the country is dependent on imported animal feed.
<br />
<br />“We don’t produce enough corn to use as animal feed. If it is imported we can’t control the price,” he told reporters after giving out bubur lambuk at his ministry.
<br />
<br />The media recently reported that chicken prices have skyrocketed and among the causes was soya and corn meal that comes mostly from Argentina and Brazil.

<br />- heat pumps installed in homes

Ending animal agriculture!!!!!!  It&#39;s happening!
<br />
<br />#Oregon bill IP13 (like Colorado Pause act) seeks to criminalize animal husbandry practices.  Sponsored by a group called &#34; End Animal Cruelty&#34; to create a sanctuary state for animals:
<br />
<br />Michelson said the initiative wouldn’t ban animal agriculture entirely, nor would it abolish the sale of meat, leather or fur in Oregon. But livestock would have to die of natural causes before it could be used for food production, and “forced impregnation” of livestock would be outlawed, he said. Violators would face criminal prosecution.

UK&#39;s DEFRA is reviewing Farming Rules for Water Regulation, which defines &#34;actions that a land manager might be expected to do in order to prevent run-off or soil erosion,&#34; and adding enforcement.  “What’s advisory today often becomes handcuffs tomorrow.&#34;
<br />
<br />What are they enforcing?
<br />
<br />- The FRfW effectively make autumn and winter spreading of manure impossible on many farms, creating a huge problem that no-one yet seems to have a solution to, warns Mr Mayson.
<br />
<br />&#34;If your crop need is zero, your justification is zero, so the amount you can spread is zero. This could lead to a situation where a lot of farmers simply won’t be able to spread their own manure on their own land.
<br />
<br />During the next five to 10 years, farmers will respond by installing extra storage facilities and there will be a big shift to spring and summer spreading, Mr Mayson predicts. But, in the short term, FRfW will be impossible to comply with.
<br />
<br />But, unless things change, he goes on, pressure from environmental groups will only get greater and that may impact on the meat- and dairy-buying groups, who are starting to become aware of the environmental impacts of some farmers and may start to impose more stringent and binding farm assurance rules.

Going vegan can help to save the planet, a Cabinet minister said today.
<br />
<br />Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the rising number of people giving up meat and dairy was helping to “drive the progress” towards the UK’s target of slashing emissions by 78 per cent.
<br />
<br />Mr Kwarteng is the most senior political figure yet to endorse veganism as a potential major contributor to the battle against climate change.
<br />

Earlier this month, French farmers fought mother nature in their attempt to prevent frost from wiping out their crops. It appears their attempts have failed as the damage is extensive and could wipe out nearly a third of French wine output for the year.

Cypress seems to be invoking the vaccine passports -- not clear if applies to grocery stores:
<br />
<br />The government on Friday imposed a fresh lockdown for two weeks between April 26 and May 9 in a bid to stem the rapid spread of Covid infections, which are threatening to overrun the island’s health system.
<br />
<br />The lockdown will be lifted on May 10 but visiting crowded venues will require negative Covid tests or being vaccinated or having gone through the illness inside the past three months. Venues include catering, places where people gather, gyms, retail outlets, theatres. It was not immediately clear if it included supermarkets as well.

Oregon Bill to BAN Livestock - Stunning War on Farming/Ranching
<br />
<br />Oregon Bill IP13 would criminalize raising food animals in the state, and reclassify animal husbandry practices as &#34;sexual assault.&#34; The bill specifies that animals can only be eaten after dying of natural causes (at which point, aged/diseased meat is not good).  Oregon&#39;s 12,000 beef producers raising about 1.3 million head of cattle are slated for elimination, as traditional farming and ranching is shut down in favor of lab-grown meat and indoor farms owned by the technocrats -- a perfect way to force the population into perfect slavery.  Christian breaks it down in this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.

“End Animal Agriculture” isn’t just the mission statement of Impossible Foods — it is a battle cry oft repeated elsewhere, as here in the Harvard Political Review:
<br />
<br />But the pandemic provides an opportunity to more deeply interrogate the structural injustice of this system. It is animal agriculture that is wrong, not simply the logistical phenomena that have caused mass culling. As we negotiate a return to normalcy, we must critically examine and dismantle the country’s unsustainable and unethical meat production pipeline.

Complexity, AI &amp; the future of food: AI’s food security impact
<br />
<br />“Few problems facing humanity are as serious as the looming food security crisis. This series has looked at the role artificial AI can play in finding solutions to this problem. These approaches include the interpretation of satellite imagery to boost yields, enhancing climate resilience, developing agrobots, and boosting food security through biometrics.
<br />
<br />This isn’t like a typical static problem in which one needs do no more than apply a little conventional thinking to come up with the perfect remedy. As discussed, AI must be applied not just to growing more of this crop or that crop, but to optimizing agriculture’s entire value chain. For that to happen, developers of such an AI system would have to draw inspiration from plant intelligence and plant functioning rather than going down the more obvious road of copying the functions of the human brain.

VANCOUVER — A shortage of veterinarians in British Columbia threatens food security and is responsible for animals suffering and dying, according the group that speaks for animal doctors in the province. 
<br />
<br />The society characterizes the situation as a &#34;crisis,&#34; describing it as the worst in Canada and saying it has myriad implications for the province&#39;s animals. The letter says animal food security is at risk, rescue groups are limited to which animals they can save, owners have had to euthanize their horses for preventable illnesses and residents with companion animals face long waits for care. 
<br />
<br />Rural veterinarians report eight weeks or longer and, in some cases, the animals die before getting the help they need.&#34;

<br />Farming Robot Kills 100,000 Weeds per Hour With Lasers
<br />A person can weed about one acre of crops a day. This smart robot can weed 20.
<br />
<br />Carbon Robotics has unveiled the third-generation of its Autonomous Weeder, a smart farming robot that identifies weeds and then destroys them with high-power lasers.
<br />
<br />The weedkiller challenge: Weeds compete with plants for space, sunlight, and soil nutrients. They can also make it easier for insect pests to harm crops, so weed control is a top concern for farmers.

The safrinha data indicates crop is in terrible shape, as expected given how delayed it was due to the last crop of soybeans being stuck in the flooded fields.
<br />
<br />This is a huge red alert. These cascading failures are no longer  “a bad season we can come back from” — we’ve been running below pipeline levels for years (ie eating through our supplies), and now we’re out. That’s why corn/soy hitting 8-year highs.
<br />
<br />Start growing food. This is an acute emergency.

Social engineering:  beef is a thing of the past.  You can&#39;t even find recipes for that old, dirty, antequated, pandemic-ridden, carbon-emitting stuff any more:
<br />
<br />Epicurious stops publication of beef recipes
<br />
<br />The decision was thought of as &#34;not anti-beef but rather pro-planet,&#34; Epicurious said
<br />
<br />The food publication cited a rise in beef consumption and its role as &#34;one of the world’s worst climate offenders&#34; for making the shift.
<br />
<br />&#34;It might not feel like much, but cutting out just a single ingredient—beef—can have an outsize impact on making a person’s cooking more environmentally friendly,&#34; Epicurious Senior Editor Maggie Hoffman and former Digital Director David Tamarkin explained in an article published Monday. &#34;Beef won’t appear in new Epicurious recipes, articles, or newsletters. It will not show up on our homepage. It will be absent from our Instagram feed.&#34;

#Cyberpandemic is continuing, with little media fanfare:
<br />
<br />&#34;MILAN – A cyber attack by hackers targeted the logistics of the capsules of one of the most important Italian and international manufacturers. This is the Caffitaly of Gaggio Montano (Bologna) on the Bolognese Apennines. So in recent days there has been a shortage of Caffitaly capsules. The reason is obvious: there were logistical problems in the deliveries suffered by the company from Gaggio Montano coinciding with the transfer of the warehouses from the headquarters on the Apennines to the new hub in the center of the Po Valley in Capriate in the province of Bergamo. Added to this was a large-scale cyber attack against one of the group’s suppliers. Which, out of prudence, convinced the company that was founded by Giovanni Zaccanti and Sergio Zappella to suspend some activities, thus slowing down distribution in a cascade...&#34;

Texas Senate passes new bill to &#34;protect state from Cyberattacks&#34;

<br />American businesses and the U.S. government have recently been the target of cyber attacks. Texas is taking matters into its own hands. The Texas state Senate Monday passed the &#34;Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act,&#34; which aims to stop certain countries from compromising its critical infrastructure.

Remember these choice quotes from Cyberpolygon 2020?  
<br />(Hear them in video here: <a href="https://iceagefarmer.com" rel="noopener">iceagefarmer.com</a> ) 
<br />
<br />Jeremy Jurgens, WEF Managing Director:
<br />“I believe that there will be another crisis. It will be more significant. It will be faster than what we’ve seen with COVID. The impact will be greater, and as a result the economic and social implications will be even more significant.”
<br />
<br />Klaus Schwab:
<br />“We all know, but still pay insufficient attention, to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack could bring a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole. The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyberattack.&#34;
<br />
<br />There is a looming cyberattack on supply chains &amp; our food supply.  Prepare.

No, I don&#39;t think this is a [long term] grid down event.  They want to retain control.

The precipitative extremes destroying crop yields in &amp; beyond the world&#39;s breadbaskets (like the record US prevent plant last year, China&#39;s damaged corn, and the drought affecting Brazil&#39;s soybean and now safrinha) are all characteristic of the LOW solar activity during Solar Cycle 24 — like that during the Dalton Grand Solar Minimum (1790-1820 — not that long ago, just not mentioned in mainstream  screams about Global Warming).
<br />
<br />The sun is forecast to be even less active during Solar Cycle 25, culminating in a drop off into Maunder like conditions in 2030 (zero sunspot activity, and even more extreme climatic conditions / worse growing seasons on Earth).
<br />
<br />That is what drive the timeline for Agenda 2030.  That is why everything feels so rushed.  It is — the elites have a deadline. 
<br />
<br />In their eyes, we must be locked down, surveilled, and eating bugs, restrained by the UN SDGs, before their control breaks down.
<br />
<br />In mine, we must prepare, and fight for liberty.

I do maintenance work-
<br />While at a Starbucks today, fixing something, I asked the manager when will Starbucks let people sit inside stores again- because none of them are allowing seating inside In Ohio and KY.
<br />Manager said they were told around 4th of July, which Starbucks is rolling something out just before then, and around the 4th is the go-live date for it.
<br />I heard something similar from a couple of other stores recently too- that “normal” service will resume in the stores around the 4th of July.
<br />Now, reflecting back, a month ago, Biden said he hopes that 2/3 of Americans will be vaxxed by the 4th of July so there can be a return to somewhat normalcy, and we can be allowed to celebrate the 4th.
<br />
<br />I am concluding (presuming) that we could see the vax passport rolled out around the 4th of July, as from what I am seeing in stores, there is work being done to put in extra equipment of some sort by entrances and POS areas, and several stores are talking about rolling something out around the 4th of July- and a return to somewhat normalcy.
<br />
<br />Looks like (they) want to hijack the 4th of July, and not in a good way.
<br />Just sharing my perspective

Victory begins when we stop playing by their rules, kick them out, and restore sanity:
<br />
<br />Vail School Board Flees, Parents Elect New Board, Vote To End Mask Mandate
<br />
<br />Hundreds of parents showed up to the Vail School Board meeting to demand the board make masks optional. The board didn&#39;t want to hear it so they walked out of the meeting before it even began. So the parents, under Robert&#39;s Rules of Order, voted in a new school board. Then, the new members voted to end the mask requirement in Vail Schools. The old school board members revealed exactly who they are and that includes GOP LD 10 Chairman, Chris King.

#Permaculture principles — not just for growing food.  
<br />
<br />Observe and interact: Engage with nature - design solutions that suit our particular situation.
<br />
<br />Catch and store energy: Collect resources at peak abundance, use in times of need. 
<br />
<br />Obtain a yield: Get truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing.
<br />
<br />Apply self-regulation and accept feedback: Systems must function well long-term.
<br />
<br />Use and value renewable resources and services: Make good use of nature&#39;s abundance.
<br />
<br />Produce no waste: Valuing &amp; use of all resources that are available to us.
<br />
<br />Design from patterns to details: Observe patterns in nature &amp; society - these are the backbone of our designs, with details filled in as we go.
<br />
<br />Integrate rather than segregate: By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other.
<br />
<br />Use small and slow solutions: Small and slow systems are easier to maintain than big ones, making better use of local resources and producing more sustainable outcomes.
<br />
<br />Use and value diversity: Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.
<br />
<br />Use edges and value the marginal: The interface between things is where the most interesting events take place. These are often the most valuable, diverse and productive elements in the system.
<br />
<br />Creatively use and respond to change: Have a positive impact on inevitable change by carefully observing, and then intervening at the right time

On the &#34;Register your livestock/animals&#34; theme — Russia today introduces mandatory microchipping — and even mentions the zoonotic risk factor (diseases spreading from animals to humans) — the global positioning for eliminating animals by 2030 continues:
<br />
<br />Russian lawmakers have introduced a new bill to the national parliament that would require owners to have their pets digitally tagged, to help track down owners and prevent attacks by stray animals released onto the streets.
<br />
<br />If passed, it would demand that pet owners take their beloved animals to the vet to be implanted with a microchip, linking them to the person responsible for them.
<br />
<br />This measure, already in force in a number of other countries across the world, will, they say, “make it possible to search for a lost pet; ensure opportunities for free travel with the animal; bring to justice unscrupulous owners who deliberately put the animal out on the street; and protect against the spread of infections between animals and humans.”

<br />Provisional records for April 2021 show the United Kingdom has experienced the most air frosts since records began in 1960, the UK Met Office reported Tuesday, April 27, 2021. This month has already seen an average of 13 days of air frosts for the country, with many farmers and growers reporting considerable damage due to the harsh conditions.

China food security: why the nation’s ‘food crisis’ is more of a livestock feed challenge

<br />  China is not producing enough feed grains such as soybeans to support its large and growing livestock industry, meaning it relies on imports

Bio-Barcodes: GMO Spores Hidden in Food to Track Supply Chain
<br />
<br />Spraying your food with genetically modified spores with custom DNA sequences in order to trace it through the global supply chain sounds like science fiction, but one company funded by SOSV -- the same VC behind &#39;food replacement&#39; companies like Memphis Meats, Finless Foods, and NotCo -- has made it a reality, and is already testing its technology.  Biological barcodes and resource tracking is clearly integral part of the blockchain/AI supply chain being rolled out as part of The Great Reset.  But what happens when you eat them?

              <div>According the the animal charity PDSA, over half of adults in the UK own a pet. Over the past year, pet sales have soared and it's thought the UK dog population alone has increased by at least 10% during lockdown - now totaling more that 11 million. However, many environmentalists are calling for people to stop having pets all together in the hope of saving the planet.

Informed consent is being criminalized: look at the language as they pivot “vaccine skepticism” to radical extremist aggression — we are being OTHERED, turned into dangerous, racist, persecuted class to be silenced and destroyed:
<br />
<br />“Today, the anti-vaccine empire has hundreds of websites and perhaps 58 million followers on social media. The bad guys [IAF: YES this is a quote!] are winning, in part because health agencies either underestimate or deny the reach of anti-science forces, and are ill-equipped to counter it.”
<br />
<br />“Many far-right extremist groups that spread false information about last year’s US presidential election are doing the same about vaccines. Anti-vaccine groups also target Black communities; an anti-vaccine documentary released in March vilifies COVID-19 vaccine testing among African Americans, calling it “medical racism”.
<br />
<br />“It is becoming increasingly clear that advancing immunization requires a counteroffensive.”
<br />
<br />— So: heads up. They are on the offensive.

In my video above, I mentioned VCs/companies that are [openly] discussing &amp; working towards a &#34;post-animal economy.&#34;
<br />
<br />Corn/soybean prices are hitting decadal-highs, and even as Brazil&#39;s safrinha fails, the US grains outlook is threatened by cold &amp; drought.  The world is on short on grains, and this hasn&#39;t really hit home yet for many.
<br />
<br />I want to draw your attention to a new media narrative:  that we are competing with animal agriculture for resources.  
<br />
<br />Bloomberg below is making the case &#34;Feeding Chickens Is So Costly It’s Changing Global Trade Flows&#34;.  Other mainstream media is echoing, &#34;China food security: why the nation’s ‘food crisis’ is more of a livestock feed challenge 
<br />
<br />We are witnessing the &#34;Solution&#34; script being laid before imminent food shortages / prices exploding — the kind that impact you:  now that we don&#39;t have enough food, we simply can&#39;t keep the real animals any more.  It&#39;s lab-grown meat from here on out. 
<br />
<br />Incidentally, this means there isn&#39;t much time before real shortages hit...
<br />
<br />... and the chorus of calls to do away with livestock grow louder ...

Going from bad to worse — the drought is becoming so severe that river transport is becoming impossible — S. America grains gridlock will accelerate global grains collapse (ie START GROWING FOOD NOW):
<br />
<br />The South American drought that’s helping push Wheat, Corn, and Soybean prices to multiyear highs isn’t just threatening crops, but also the ability to haul them on waterways that are drying up.
<br />
<br />On the increasingly shallow rivers that flow through top producers Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, barges are carrying less than their usual load. The situation is so desperate in Paraguay that the country is asking neighboring Brazil to release water from the giant Itaipu hydroelectric dam, after vessels have run aground and logjams are forming in river ports because barges can’t move. In a key Argentine leg of the 4,900-kilometer (3,000-mile) Parana River, uncertainty over dredging work could make it even harder for farmers to ship their harvests.

High prices nibble at corn&#39;s sway as Asian feed buyers switch to wheat
<br />
<br />SINGAPORE, April 27 (Reuters) - Asian feed manufacturers are switching to wheat in animal rations as multi-year high corn prices constrict demand for the yellow grain widely used to fatten hogs and chickens.
<br />
<br />Some of the world&#39;s top corn buyers such as China, South Korea and Vietnam are buying more wheat from Australia and the Black Sea region in the months ahead as the landed cost of corn has climbed to a rare premium to wheat, said two Singapore-based grains traders.
<br />
<br />Combined, those three countries are forecast to buy 26.4% of global corn imports this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, so any substitution for wheat could have a large impact on global grain trade flows.

Edible Insects as a Potential Food Source: Benefits vs. Food Safety Issues
<br />
<br />The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations recently released a publication detailing various food safety issues that could be associated with edible insects. According to the FAO, the benefits of edible insects as an emerging food source must be weighed against potential food safety issues. 
<br />
<br />Possible food safety issues for edible insects include biological, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, chemical hazards, pesticides, heavy metals, antimicrobials, and physical hazards.

NYTimes laying on the FEAR thick -- Meat is DIRTY and DANGEROUS:
<br />
<br />&#34;I’m a vegan, but I’m also a realist. There’s no chance humanity is going to give up meat, en masse, anytime soon. That said, we can’t just wish away the risks of industrial animal agriculture. If we don’t end this system, soon, terrible things will happen to us and to the planet. Terrible things are already happening.&#34;

DeutscheBank Warns Soaring Food Prices Will Lead To Social Unrest
<br />
<br />Today, DB&#39;s Jim Reid picked that chart as his &#34;Chart of the day&#34;, repeating what readers already know, namely that Bloomberg’s agriculture spot index has risen by c.76% year-on-year, noting that &#34;that’s the biggest annual rise in nearly a decade, and there are only a couple of other comparable episodes since the index begins back in 1991.&#34;
<br />
<br />The DB strategist then goes all-in and says what everyone is thinking, namely that &#34;this trend of higher food prices leading to social unrest extends far back into history and surrounds many key turning points. The French Revolution of 1789, which overthrew the Ancien Régime, came after a succession of poor harvests that led to major rises in food prices. It was a similar story at the time of Europe’s 1848 revolutions too, which followed the failure of potato crops in the 1840s and the associated severe famine in much of Europe. And the 1917 overthrow of the Tsarist regime in Russia took place in the context of food shortages as well.&#34;

China institutes “No Pig Zones” to limit the flow of #AfricanSwineFever .
<br />
<br />What’s left unsaid here:  this sets the stage for use of 4IR tech like tagging &amp; geofencing to prevent epidemiological spread — now it is needed for your safety:
<br />
<br />“With new guidelines expected to be in place in a matter of days, areas known for little or no pig farming will have to increase capacity. 
<br />
<br />&#34;Some areas that used to call themselves no-pig counties or no-pig cities will have to build pig farms,&#34; Guofa said.

EU to launch carbon farming framework by end-2021 following two-year study
<br />
<br />In the ‘Farm To Fork Strategy‘ announced as part of its European Green Deal last year, the EU stated that farming practices which “remove CO2 from the atmosphere contribute to the [EU’s] climate neutrality objective and should be rewarded, either via [EU policies] or other public or private initiatives [such as a] carbon market.”
<br />
<br />It added that a “carbon farming initiative [will be set up] to promote this new business model, which provides farmers with a new source of income and helps other sectors to decarbonize the food chain.” Furthermore, the strategy tasked the Commission to “develop a regulatory framework for certifying carbon removals based on robust and transparent carbon accounting to monitor and verify [their] authenticity.”

‘Megadrought’ in American West May Trigger First-Ever Water Shortage Declaration
<br />
<br />The American West has been suffering from what’s sometimes referred to as a “megadrought,” centered around the Colorado River, for years.  And this week, things are accelerating, on both a state and federal level, as government officials (and farmers) prepare for the worst.
<br />
<br />Arizona and Nevada would automatically be subject to significant cuts in water access
<br />
<br />In response, the Biden administration announced the formation of an Interagency Working Group, chaired by both the Departments of Agriculture and Interior, to determine how to cope with the worsening drought. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a drought emergency in two counties in the northern parts of the state. This comes with a huge reduction in the amount of available water for agriculture in the region—primarily grapes in wine country.

Martin Armstrong again writing today about #GlobalCooling / #GrandSolarMinimum:
<br />
<br />Our model has projected we are entering another “grand-minimum,” which will overtake the sun beginning in 2020 and will last lasting through the 2050s, resulting in diminished magnetism, infrequent sunspot production, and less ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching Earth. This all means we are facing a global cooling period in the planet that may span 31 to 43 years. The last grand-minimum event produced the mini-Ice Age in the mid-17th century. Known as the Maunder Minimum, it occurred between 1645 and 1715, during a longer span of time when parts of the world became so cold that the period was called the Little Ice Age, which lasted from about 1300 to 1850.

Germany: April brought frost and snow - to the suffering of the fruit growers.
<br />
<br />Setbacks are normal, in spring as in life, snow and cold are more the rule than the exception. But spring 2021 has exaggerated its predilection for frosty falls, polar air flooded the pandemic-weary continent at regular intervals: lockdown and &#34;flockdown&#34; are constant companions. And for the first time in decades, April will be much too cold on average . The last days of the month won&#39;t change that either.
<br />
<br />The year 2021 produced April as it used to be known: capricious and uncontrolled. It can feel like a warm June and a short time later like a grim February. Typical April weather. The current average temperature is 5.1 degrees, which means the spring month is almost four degrees colder compared to the new reference period from 1991 to 2020. Even in relation to the mean for the years 1961 to 1990, the temperature is 2.3 degrees Celsius lower. The last time there was such a negative monthly deviation was almost ten years ago. If the end of the month were now, we would have the coldest April since 1973 behind us.
<br />
<br />The cold air flooded large parts of Europe as far as the southern tip of Italy and Crete. At the same time, further east in parts of Russia it was clearly too warm for the time of year. The ingress of cold air was caused by a special weather constellation. A strong high south of Iceland contrasted with a strong low over Scandinavia. While the high rotates clockwise, the air masses in the low move in the opposite direction. As a result, together they conducted arctic air far south in an intense north-westerly current.

#Italy: &#34;After visiting all the main fruit-growing areas in Italy, I can say that in 2021 there will be even fewer kiwis in Italy than in 2020,&#34; said Pietro Cimatti, fruit-growing expert.
<br />
<br />The situation in Emilia-Romagna is slightly better than last year, when the frost had impacted very heavily. This year the damage was patchy. &#34;However, in other growing areas, such as Veneto and Piedmont, the quantities have more than halved. In some areas the temperature has dropped to 7-8°C below zero, so there is little left to save.&#34;

People in southern Madagascar have been reduced to eating wild leaves and locusts to stave off starvation after consecutive drought and sandstorms ruined harvests, leaving hundreds of thousands on the brink of famine, according to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).
<br />
<br />Speaking by videolink from Madagascar’s capital, Antananarivo, Daoudi told a UN briefing in Geneva he had visited villages where “people have had to resort to desperate survival measures, such as eating locusts, raw red cactus fruits or wild leaves”.
<br />
<br />“Famine looms in southern Madagascar as communities witness an almost total disappearance of food sources which has created a full-blown nutrition emergency,” Daoudi said.

Analyst:  U.S. on verge of running out of soybeans by mid-July
<br />
<br />&#34;The average American celebrates Independence Day on July 4 with gatherings of family and friends, barbecues, parades, concerts and fireworks. However, farmers, ranchers and those that produce agricultural products such as soy oil and meal, as well ag speculators, will witness a different kind of fireworks in mid-July because the United States may literally run out of soybeans for domestic use.
<br />
<br />“Two years ago, projected U.S carryout stocks were estimated to be 900 million bushels. A year ago, ending supplies were pegged at 523 million bushels. Now, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast stocks of U.S. soybeans at 190 million bushels,” I wrote. “My work suggests ending stocks to be under 100 million. And the historic decline with ending U.S. soybean stocks has many whispering, ‘Are we going to run out?’”
<br />
<br />In the final paragraphs of the same column, I wrote: “It has been shocking the USDA lowered soybean stocks so dramatically as it did over the past few months. Such data sets the stage for higher and just maybe unprecedented soybean prices, depending on Chinese buying habits and the weather issues plaguing several of the world’s major grain producers.
<br />
<br />[...]
<br />
<br />Imagine, if you will, a stiff price rationing rally underway for soybeans — or corn — when suddenly weather issues surface in the heart of the growing season.
<br />
<br />How high could prices possibly spike on the upside in light of the potential for the United States to “run outta” soybeans in mid-July? Just how high would soybean prices have to rally to kill demand?
<br />
<br />Moving forward, soybean prices are poised to embark on a price rationing rally to prevent a scenario where soybean crushers simply cannot find soybeans.

And continuing from previous post — we ARE having weather issues in US.  So running out of soybeans for domestic use is not just possible, but increasingly probably.
<br />
<br />Look for US to start importing beans — this is a next huge red flag.

<br />We may see some fireworks in mid-July ... and not the patriotic ones.

CONFIRMED — US  *is* importing soybeans — just getting reported.  
<br />
<br />Perdue shipping one cargo of Brazil soybeans into the U.S.– Cargonave data
<br />
<br />U.S.-based meat processor Perdue is shipping one cargo of 31,450 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans into the United States, according to line-up data from shipping agency Cargonave, as stocks dwindle in the destination market.
<br />
<br />Brazil, the world&#39;s largest soy producer and exporter, very seldom sells to the United States. China is the main buyer of its soy.&#34;
<br />
<br />Again — this is a red flag for US (TOP exporter of soybeans) domestic supplies being so short that companies are looking to source elsewhere.

<br />For €140 (£121) Spalik, 19, will provide four birds plus a coop, a fence, feed and care instructions. Chicken renters must have an outdoor space of 25m square of grass. The minimum rental period is two weeks. Customers include retirement homes and people who want to try out keeping chickens before deciding whether to buy.

<br />“The hens have been used as therapy animals in retirement homes,” Spalik said. “People with dementia respond well to them.

Cascading supply chain failures - affecting agriculture:
<br />
<br />“It&#39;s finding the raw materials,” says Nic Beck, of Nebraska-based Clarks Ag Supply that produces seed tenders. “That&#39;s really what the issue comes down to. It&#39;s the steel, the tube steel, especially, for our augers that go into our seed tenders on our machines. It&#39;s just really hard to come by.”
<br />
<br />He says it’s not just trouble in sourcing supplies at a reasonable price that’s turned into an issue. He says supply is short no matter where you try to source it.
<br />
<br />“The price of tube steel in one week went up 150% for 10-gauge tubes of steel,” says Beck. “And then it just couldn&#39;t be found. There&#39;s nothing around for it.”
<br />
<br />Beck says the raw materials are being pinched by transportation issues, but it’s also turned into a shortage of sourcing the correct parts to run the machines.
<br />
<br />“The company that cuts out the holes on a part, they had just a small $10 part break and all a sudden it shut down a million-dollar machine for two weeks and put a backlog on everything,&#34; he adds.

As the 2021 planting season is officially underway, many farm inputs and supplies are seeing a shortage. An ag chemistry shortage is impacting those trying to control weeds, but the pinch on products covers much more than crop inputs today.
<br />
<br />“There&#39;s been a couple key things that have just really caused the supply chain to get backed up,” says Derrik Ellingson, chief strategic officer for Ellingson Companies in Fargo, N.D.
<br />
<br />Ellingson Companies installs drainage tile and serves a number of industries, including agriculture. The company, which has been in business since 1970, says it focuses on waters solutions for its customers, and this year, a shortage of plastic supplies means installing drainage is coming at an added cost.
<br />
<br />“There&#39;s definitely a shortage,” says Ellingson. “And obviously, when there&#39;s high demand, these guys are going to capitalize, which is driving the price up. And there is a shortage.”
<br />
<br />He says anything that is a plastic-based product is in short supply.
<br />
<br />“I don&#39;t think anyone could have ever expected the demand for plastic to drive through the roof,” he explains. “The car industry, boats, SUVs, side by sides, ATVs, home projects, all these decks people are putting in that’s plastic decking. Everybody is spending money taking care of these things. So, it&#39;s just completely compounded into a problem that we are faced with here today.&#34;
<br />
<br />From demand, to now production problems at plants, it’s a problem that first popped up last summer.
<br />
<br />“Those hurricanes [last summer]  took many of the petrochemical facilities offline for a period of time,” says Jennifer Van Dinter, head of integrated analytics, S&amp;P Global Platts.“That&#39;s kind of what started this whole domino effect. And since then, there were more outages in December that were not necessarily planned events for maintenance. And then we had the deep freeze that hit Houston, New Orleans, and all of the areas in between that took so many of those plastics plants, as well as refineries, offline for several weeks in many cases.”
<br />
<br />As a result, from the raw goods to the end product, plastics prices are racing higher.

Russian COVID-19 Vaccine in the Form of Yogurt? 
<br />
<br />Russian scientists are developing a vaccine against the new coronavirus, which can be introduced into the body in the form of yogurt. The agency quoted a statement from Vladimir Chekhonin, vice president of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
<br />
<br />The work on the creation of the vaccine is carried out by the Institute of Experimental Medicine in St. Petersburg. It refers to the type of mucosal vaccine that is given into the body by mouth in the form of an aerosol or drops.
<br />
<br />As a rule, the antigens of such preparations are enclosed in microcapsules, which protects them from digestive enzymes. &#34;The target for cloning is a gene encoding the S-protein of the coronavirus. As a result, the gene is introduced to the area that codes probiotic bacteria pili, creating a bacterium with an immunogenic viral protein on its surface. Such a vaccine can be administered in the form of a product such as yogurt. Preclinical trials of this vaccine are currently underway&#34; said Chekhonin.
