WELL PUT: decarbonization strangling food production: 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; “A close friend farms over 10,000 acres of corn in the mid-west. The property is spread out over 3 counties. His operation is a &#34;partnership farm&#34; with John Deere. They use the larger farm operations as demonstration projects for promotion and development of new equipment. He recently received a phone call from his John Deere representative, and they want the farm to go to electric tractors and combines in 2023. He currently has 5 diesel combines that cost $900,000 each that are traded in every 3 years. Also, over 10 really BIG tractors. JD wants him to go all electric soon.
<br />
<br />He said: &#34;Ok, I have some questions. 
<br />
<br />- How do I charge these combines when they are 3 counties away from the shop in the middle of a cornfield, in the middle of nowhere?
<br />
<br />- How do I run them 24 hours a day for 10 or 12 days straight when the harvest is ready, and the weather is coming in?
<br />
<br />- How do I get a 50,000+ lb. combine that takes up the width of an entire road back to the shop 20 miles away when the battery goes dead?
<br />
<br />There was dead silence on the other end of the phone.
<br />
<br />When the corn is ready to harvest, it has to have the proper sugar and moisture content. If it is too wet, it has to be put in giant dryers that burn natural or propane gas, and lots of it. Harvest time is critical because if it degrades in sugar content or quality, it can drop the value of his crop by half a million dollars or more. It is analyzed at time of sale. It is standard procedure to run these machines 10 to 12 days straight, 24 hours a day at peak harvest time. When they need fuel, a tanker truck delivers it, and the machines keep going. John Deere&#39;s only answer is &#34;we&#39;re working on it.&#34; They are being pushed by the Zero carbon agenda to force these electric machines on the American farmer. 
<br />
<br />These people are out of control. They are messing with the production of food crops that feed people and livestock... all in the name of their &#34;green dream.&#34;
<br />Look for the cost of your box of cornflakes to triple in the next 24 months...”
<br />
<br />Wake up! Stand up! Speak up!
<br />Let&#39;s return sanity to our nation.

Finland: grocery stores may close to conserve power
<br />
<br />Grocery stores in Finland could have to take turns closing for hours at a time to reduce their energy usage this winter, the country’s grid operator told news outlet YLE on Sunday. With fuel shortages expected, Finnish households will also be told to lower their consumption.
<br />
<br />According to the grid operator, Finland’s roughly 2,800 food stores will need to come to arrangements with each other over who will close and who will stay open if power is rationed in a particular area. This kind of agreement is especially important in rural areas to ensure that all the outlets in one town or village don’t end up shutting at the same time, YLE noted.

Global Poultry Culling Doubles to 94.2 million kills as Food Shortage Crisis Deepens
<br />
<br />The number of poultry culled around the world has almost doubled this season as global food shortages loom and the cost of living crisis deepens.
<br />
<br />Experts are warning that an “unprecedented” bird flu outbreak has caused a huge spike in culling since last season.
<br />
<br />According to figures from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), more than 22 million cases have been reported in wild birds and poultry so far this season in 68 countries.
<br />
<br />This figure is double the 11m recorded between October 2020 and September 2021, itself an all-time high.
<br />
<br />In an effort to curb the outbreak, 94.2m farmed poultry have been killed and disposed of.
<br />
<br />Last season, 54.4m were culled.

All three Canadian Prairie Provinces say NO to Trudeau’s starvation policy [fight fight fight!!!]
<br />
<br />The Prairie Provinces are in revolt, with the Premiers of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba unanimously rejecting Trudeau’s proposed fertilizer reduction policy.
<br />
<br />In a letter to Justin Trudeau, Manitoba Premier Heather Stefanson had this to say about the proposed policy:
<br />
<br />“Your government’s national emissions reduction targets are being brought forward at the worst possible time. They will negatively impact producer yields, which will mean higher grocery bills and less food security for families. This cannot be another blow to the affordability of raising a family in Manitoba.
<br />
<br />Agricultural producers in Manitoba regarding the federal policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent from nutrient use by 2030. Their major concerns are unanimous. This policy would lower their crop yields and decrease revenue. Manitoba’s competitiveness in producing and processing protein will be reduced while lowering our province’s capacity to export the agricultural commodities that other countries rely upon to process food.

One such project by WEF partner IBM is called &#34;IBM Food Trust&#34;: A new era in the world’s food supply.
<br />
<br />It is being marketed for safety (recalls) and peace of mind:
<br />
<br />&#34;Parents want to know, quite rightly, where ingredients they give to their baby have come from.&#34;
<br />
<br />&#34;...and so we at IBM/WEF developed a solution to replace natural abundance with techno-chains and smart packaging, only selling it to those who bow to our agenda!  Parents, your children will never know freedom, but at least you&#39;ll know where that Gogurt came from!&#34;

<br />ARCHITECTING THE BEAST SYSTEM: AI Control of Food Supply
<br />
<br />Forces are working to take total control of every drop of oil extracted from the ground, every fish caught from the sea, and every last bean harvested. It requires an immense technical infrastructure comprising 5G, blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence. This infrastructure has been built and is now being deployed, and we must understand that it is — in the very words of the Department of Defense — an AI weapons system. And that system is going live NOW. Christian breaks it down.

Capitalismo vegano: multinacionales alimentarias y BlackRock

<br />(Vegan Capitalism: Food Multinationals and BlackRock)
<br />After seducing the population with the supposed wonders of the vegan diet, multinational meat companies and BlackRock/Vanguard have landed in the &#34;alternative agriculture&#34; sector
<br />
<br />Although it may seem contradictory, the main transnational industrial meat production companies are the ones behind foods that, based on vegetables or proteins grown in laboratories, are presented as substitutes for meat, fish, eggs and milk.
<br />
<br />[IAF: Yep, multinational food companies Nestle, Tyson, Smithfield, JBS are all working on fake meat — and many are WEF partners ! ]

The Solution To The Current Food Crisis Is Small And Local, Including Growing Food Locally.
<br />
<br />Community currency expert Thomas Greco, author of “The End of Money,” maintains that a produce-backed currency could be issued without even creating a cryptocurrency. A group of local farmers could be organized to jointly issue farm currency as a paper or digital community currency, which could be spent into circulation to buy what the farmers needed to produce their crops. The currency would circulate in the local community and would be accepted back by the farmers in payment for the products they sell.
<br />
<br />“So the currency has a beginning and an end, it’s created and it’s extinguished,” says Greco. “It’s created by the act of spending and it’s extinguished in the act of redemption, not in some other currency, but in goods and services that have been promised.”
<br />
<br />IAF: Glad to see the discussion around local food systems AND new currencies outside CBs/CBDC — personally not a fan of using cryptos, so enjoyed these ideas and hope we can have those discussions]

              <div>“Deglobalizing” and “dedollarizing” have been much in the news. Reducing dependence on the global supply chain and the U.S. dollar are trends that are happening not just internationally but locally. In the United States, we have seen movements both for local food independence and to divest from Wall Street banks. The burgeoning cryptocurrency movement is another push to “dedollarize” and escape the international bankers’ control grid.  This article is a sequel to one discussing home gardens and community food co-ops as local counter-measures to an impending food crisis.</div>

Greece rolls out digital ‘wallet’ for citizens; ID and driving license now on phone
<br />
<br />[IAF: No doubt this is the kind of &#39;digital transformation&#39; described for Ukraine as well... and everywhere...]
<br />
<br />Greece has rolled out a mobile app that will replace the need to carry a police ID or a driver’s license in physical form, allowing faster transactions through a secure system calling for digital confirmation through a QR code, among others.
<br />
<br />In addition, “We are creating a system for banks and telecom providers starting October 1, as well as for agencies requiring the user to show an ID. A digital trace will be created instead of copies of one’s ID, turning into digital proof something that has been a burden to provide in physical form,” the minister said, referring to the police IDs required for most official transactions.

That sewer wastewater monitoring is sure turning out to be handy in the surveillance state.
<br />__
<br />
<br />Polio found in more wastewater samples in upstate New York’s Orange County
<br />
<br />Wastewater samples taken from two different locations in Orange County in June and July tested positive for the virus, state officials told county leaders earlier this week.
<br />
<br />The findings come days after the New York State Department of Health found similar evidence of community spread in sewage samples taken in neighboring Rockland despite no additional cases being reported.
<br />
<br />State officials are urging anyone who is not vaccinated against the potentially life-threatening virus to get immunized after an unvaccinated adult in Rockland suffered paralysis and had to be hospitalized last month.

Borden Dairy Co. will immediately close its Alabama plant because “it could no longer support continued production,” according to a report.
<br />
<br />Employees are being laid off. “Borden Dairy will close its Dothan, AL and Hattiesburg, MS milk production facilities by no later than September 30, 2022, and will no longer produce in these states,” according to the company’s statement.
<br />
<br />IAF: the article neglects to mention that this flows from Blackrock imposing ESG scores that are killing dairy industry.

<br />German food banks suffer as former donors forced to become recipients
<br />
<br />“People who used to be on the other side donating and helping us are now coming and asking for help,&#34; says Petra Lehmann, who heads the Heimatstern association. &#34;We have lots of families now where it&#39;s impossible from one income to feed the family because it&#39;s so expensive.&#34;
<br />This is also changing people&#39;s behaviors. &#34;We buy more jars of cheap food,&#34; says Sertap. &#34;It may be chicken. It could be fish, beans because they are more suitable for us.&#34;
<br />
<br />Pensioner Katrin Obermeier has started rationing her food: &#34;I&#39;m using foods longer, especially past the expiration date because it is still well preserved.&#34; 
<br />
<br />[IceAgeFarmer note: this is true BUT remember that removal of date markings by end of 2022 was planned in the 2018 EU Farm to Fork agenda!! We are following the globalist food crisis scripts to a T!!]

Should China own American farmland? 
<br />
<br />&gt; USDA’s latest data shows China owns over 191,000 acres of U.S. lands, but that was before a North Dakota land sale this Spring.
<br />
<br />A Chinese company, Fufeng Group, recently acquired 300 acres in North Dakota for $2.6 million. According to the company, it intends to establish a milling plant.

Emergence of &#34;black market food&#34; more expensive than the government rations — we will witness this anywhere there is rationing.
<br />
<br />Lebanese face long ‘insulting’ queues to buy bread
<br />
<br />Khalil Mansour has to queue for hours every day just to buy bread for his family and some days he can’t afford any. In a country which once boasted the nickname “Switzerland of the Middle East” for its thriving banking sector before financial crisis hit in 2019, the chronic shortage of the staple of the Lebanese diet has been hard to take.
<br />
<br />Faced with demands from international creditors for painful reforms in return for the release of new aid, the embattled government has been forced to end subsidies on most essential goods — although not so far on wheat. The price of subsidised bread has gone up, although by less than if there were no subsidy, but bakeries have started rationing the staple. A bag of flat Arabic pitta-like bread now officially sells for 13,000 Lebanese pounds (43 US cents). On the black market it costs more than 30,000. “Last week I went without bread for three days because I cannot afford to pay 30,000,” said Mansour, 48.
<br />
<br />For Mansour and most Lebanese, buying bread means standing for hours in long queues outside bakeries and sometimes, when their turn comes, the bakeries have run out of bread.

France: milk shortages feared
<br />
<br />The president of the largest farmers&#39; union in France has warned that a shortage of feedstock caused by severe drought may lead to a milk shortage.
<br />
<br />&#34;I think that in the coming months, we will have a shortage of milk in France. To make milk, you need fodder, mainly alfalfa and corn, which have grown little this year.”

Another grain mill mysteriously burns to the ground completely after spontaneously combusting.
<br />
<br />Somehow all fire control systems failed in this facility...and the hundreds of other food supply plants that have burned this year.
<br />
<br />Somehow it&#39;s like the fire safety was shut off...

<br />In June — just 60 days ago! — Grain Craft announced it had been acquired by the Baltimore-based Redwood Capital Investments, headed by billionaires Jim Davis and Stephen Bisciotti.
<br />
<br />And — somehow — now they are collecting on the insurance as starvation looms.
<br />
<br />(Remember just a few months back billionaire Glen Taylor roasted 5.3 million birds alive &#34;because #BirdFlu&#34; — but then fired all the workers and shutdown his poultry plant completely!?  These billionaires are getting the call...)

ALSO — obligatory reminder — if you get a Direct Message from “Ice Age Farmer” (often calling you a “patriot” and/or trying to sell crypto), please BLOCK &amp; REPORT the imposter.
<br />
<br />These scammers even try to scam me, not realizing I am the person they are impersonating!

<br />I tried to appeal here to any remaining humanity, but you can see he just sticks to the scam script, throwing out Qanon nonsense and trying to sell crypto.
